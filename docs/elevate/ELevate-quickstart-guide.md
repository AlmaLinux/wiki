# ELevate Quickstart Guide

::: warning
Before beginnning, we **HIGHLY** recommend that you follow system administration best practices and make sure you have backups and/or snapshots of your system before you proceed. It is recommended to do a trial run in a sandbox to verify that migration worked as expected before you attempt to migrate any production system. Please report any issues encountered to the [AlmaLinux Bug Tracker](https://bugs.almalinux.org) and/or [AlmaLinux Chat Migration Channel](https://chat.almalinux.org/almalinux/channels/migration)
:::

:::danger
The ELevate project supports only CentOS repositories. It doesn't support other external repositories.
:::

This guide contains steps on how to upgrade CentOS 7 to RHEL8 derivatives such as AlmaLinux, CentOS Stream, Oracle, and Rocky Linux. 

You need CentOS 7 system installed to use this guide.


* Fully updated system is required to accomplish the upgrade. So, install the latest CentOS updates first, and reboot.
 ```
    sudo yum update -y
    sudo reboot
 ```


* Install `elevate-release` package with the project repo and GPG key.
 ```
    sudo yum install -y http://repo.almalinux.org/elevate/elevate-release-latest-el7.noarch.rpm
 ```


* Install leapp packages and migration data for the OS you want to upgrade. Possible options are:
    * leapp-data-almalinux
    * leapp-data-centos
    * leapp-data-oraclelinux
    * leapp-data-rocky
 ```
    sudo yum install -y leapp-upgrade leapp-data-almalinux
 ```

* Start a preupgrade check. In the meanwhile, the Leapp utility creates a special */var/log/leapp/leapp-report.txt* file that contains possible problems and recommended solutions. No rpm packages will be installed at this phase.

:::warning
Preupgrade check will fail as the default CentOS 7 doesn't meet all requirements for migration.
:::

 ```
    sudo leapp preupgrade
 ```

This summary report will help you get a picture of whether it is possible to continue the upgrade.

:::tip
In certain configurations, Leapp generates */var/log/leapp/answerfile* with true/false questions. Leapp utility requires answers to all these questions in order to proceed with the upgrade.
:::

* The following fixes from *the /var/log/leapp/leapp-report.txt* file are mandatory, but you can also review the rest of them if needed.
```
   sudo rmmod pata_acpi
   echo PermitRootLogin yes | sudo tee -a /etc/ssh/sshd_config
   sudo leapp answer --section remove_pam_pkcs11_module_check.confirm=True
```


* Start an upgrade. You'll be offered to reboot the system after this process is completed.
 ```
    sudo leapp upgrade
    sudo reboot
```

* A new entry in GRUB called `ELevate-Upgrade-Initramfs` will appear. The system will be automatically booted into it.
   See how the update process goes in the console.

* After reboot, login to the system and check how the migration went. Verify that the current OS is the one you need.
 ```
   cat /etc/redhat-release
   cat /etc/os-release
   rpm -qa | grep centos
   rpm -qf | grep el7
```
