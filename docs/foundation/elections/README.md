# AlmaLinux OS Foundation Board Elections

The AlmaLinux OS Foundation is lead by a board of elected directors.

The process for these elections is defined in a few different documents. Primarily, the [AlmaLinux OS Foundation Bylaws](https://almalinux.org/p/foundation-bylaws/). It's further clarified in [Election processes and board terms](foundation/elections/processesandterms).

# How an election works

The AlmaLinux bylaws were set up to include regular elections, to ensure AlmaLinux could achieve the goal of all foundation members having a voice.

- An election committee is appointed by the board, made up of community members and a board member who is not standing for election.
- Any person who is a member in good standing for at least three months by the time the election started is eligible to be nominated for a seat on the Board of Directors.
- The election runs for at least two weeks. If the minimum quorum of 50% membership participation is not reached, the election is extended until a quorum is reached.
