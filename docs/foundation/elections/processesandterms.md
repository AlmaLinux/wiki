# AlmaLinux OS Foundation election processes and board terms

V1.0 - Adopted April 10th, 2024 [at the 31st board meeting](/Transparency.html#minutes-of-almalinux-os-foundation-board-meetings)

# General

The AlmaLinux OS Foundation is managed by a Member-elected Board of Directors that is the ultimate authority responsible for the organization as a Delaware corporation with 501(c)6 tax-exempt status. The Board's responsibilities include oversight of the organization, including its operations, staff and budget; setting strategic direction and defining goals in line with the mission; satisfying financial and other regulations. The Board is composed of directors elected by the foundation members.

As a true corporate board, board members must agree to, and comply with, the AlmaLinux OS Foundation's conflict of interest policy and [Board of Directors Operations and Code of Ethics](https://almalinux.org/p/foundation-board-operations-and-ethics/), and all directors are expected to participate in scheduled Board meetings, any special meetings that may arise, and in the ongoing discussions related to the Foundation.

Elections for Board members are conducted by a Board-appointed and independent Election Committee, comprising at least one director not seeking election in the ballot and other uninvolved experts able to manage the mechanics of the election. The Election Committee may appoint a Returning Officer who has ultimate authority in the event of any dispute concerning the election.

As outlined in the Bylaws Article IV Section 2:

The number of Directors shall be at least twice the number of Platinum Members, up to a maximum of thirteen in all.

# Elections, Nominations, and Director Selection

### Voting Method

Voting for all elections shall be done online using a voting platform or software like[ Helios Voting](https://vote.heliosvoting.org/). When elections are held, all parties eligible to vote shall receive an email notification with instructions on how to access the online voting systems, instructions on how to complete their vote, and a list of the candidates with further information about them and their interests/qualifications.

### Election Schedule

The initial election was held in September of 2022. Elections shall take place at least every 3 years, from the initial election, or as deemed necessary by the board in the case of any special elections or any vacancy.

Elections shall be announced no earlier than 45 days prior to the election taking place, opening nominations for the election. The nominee list shall be approved by the election manager and considered finalized no later than 10 days before the election date and shall be shared, along with information on nominees, to all eligible voting supporters or posted publicly. Elections shall then be open for not less than 10 days post-nominee listing.

### Additional Term Limits

A person may not be elected to the board if their continuous membership of the board exceeds six years. They may however stand for election again after a break of at least one year.

### Nominees

Nominees for all elected categories must be members in good standing (i.e. a member for 3 months, in compliance with the conflict of interest policy, code of conduct, current on any dues, and not under any restriction or sanction by the board).

Each nominee must be submitted to the election committee by a member in good standing (a member may not nominate themself). After submission, the nominee will be reviewed by the election committee, and the nomination status will be communicated to the nominee. The nominee must then confirm their interest in being elected to the board of directors. The timeline for nomination is defined earlier in this document, under Election Schedule.

### Process

Members will cast votes for seats according to the number of seats open, weighted appropriately for each member type, as defined in the membership benefits

### Removal & Vacancies

Processes for removing and replacing a member from the board is outlined in the AlmaLinux OS Foundation Bylaws.
