## Getting Help Recommendations

For the convenience of all Community members and a faster response, we advise minding these recommendations when posting a question/issue:
* Formulate a question/problem. It should be formulated clearly and easily to understand.
* Provide as many details including software/hardware information as possible.
* Provide any logs that might be relevant and helpful.
* [Provide any command output](#providing-an-output) that might be relevant and helpful.

### Providing an output

When asking for assistance, we kindly ask you to use the mentioned below ways of sharing any output.

Note, that it's preferable and recommended to use `bash` syntax.

#### paste.almalinux.org

We suggest you use the [https://paste.almalinux.org/](https://paste.almalinux.org/) service for sharing your outputs. 

* Navigate to [https://paste.almalinux.org/](https://paste.almalinux.org/)
* Select `bash` syntax.
* Create a file name that is easy to understand.

#### Markdown code block

Another way to send your output is to use Markdown elements to enter your code/output. 

**This example is based on Mattermost chat.** 

* Click on the `code` chat element.

  ![image](/images/help-and-support-chat-element-1.png)

  
* It will create an input code element - \``. Extend it to be a code block and add bash syntax. Write your output into this code block.

  \```bash<br>
  enter your output<br>
  \```

  That is how it will look in the chat:
