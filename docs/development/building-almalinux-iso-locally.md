# Building AlmaLinux ISO locally

This guide walks you through the process of building AlmaLinux OS ISO on your local AlmaLinux OS 9 machine. 

## Prerequisites

### System Requirements

* AlmaLinux OS 9 machine
* At least 6 CPU cores are recommended 
* 8+ GB RAM
* 300+ GB free storage space needed for the Docker container

### Software Requirements

A basic knowledge of these tools is needed for successful building of an AlmaLinux ISO image:
* Ansible
* Docker

## Get Your Machine Ready

The following steps describe how to prepare your AlmaLinux 9 machine to build an ISO image.

- Install Docker CE.
- Clone this GitHub repository [pungi-node-public](https://github.com/AlmaLinux/pungi-node-public) and switch to the repository's folder to proceed with the next steps.
- Install Ansible from the EPEL repository:
    ```bash
    dnf install epel-release #enable the repository
    dnf install ansible #install Ansible
    ```

## Setting Up an Ansible Inventory

Before building AlmaLinux OS ISO images, you need to configure Ansible parameters.

1. **Navigate to the Inventory Directory**: Change to the cloned repository and navigate to the `inventories` folder.
    ```bash
    cd ~/pungi-node-public/inventories
    ```
2. **Copy Sample Configuration**: The `inventories` directory contains a `sample` folder with default settings. Create a copy of this folder and give it a name of your choice, for example, `almalinux`.
    ```bash
    cp -r sample almalinux
    ```
3. **Edit Inventory Settings**: Switch to the newly created directory to modify the Ansible inventory.
    ```bash
    cd ~/pungi-node-public/inventories/almalinux
    ```
    :::warning
    Don't forget to replace the `almalinux` folder name with your chosen name in the following commands and examples.
    :::
4. **Add SSH Keys**: Navigate to the `inventories/almalinux/group_vars/` directory and add your public SSH key to the `ssh_public_keys` variable in the `all.yml` file.

5. **Specify Work Directory**: Change to the `inventories/almalinux/host_vars` directory and edit the `<arch>.yml` file, where `<arch>` is your system's architecture (e.g., `x86_64.yml`).

    :::tip
    Ensure that the storage containing your work directory has at least 300 GB of free space, as it will host a local mirror with packages.
    :::
    Update the `work_directory_path` parameter in this file to specify your work directory.

6. **Configure Host Parameters**: Return to the `inventories/almalinux` directory and edit the `hosts.yml` file to update the `ansible_host` and `ansible_user` parameters. Make sure that the specified user has passwordless sudo access.

:::tip 
By default, the Ansible inventory is set to build ISOs for the x86_64 architecture. In case you need to build an ISO for another architecture, make these changes:
* Replace *x86_64* with architecture of your choice in the names of files:
    * **x86_64.yml** in the *inventories/almalinux/group_vars* directory
    * **x86_64.yml**, **x86_64-al8.yml**, **x86_64-al9.yml** files in the *inventories/almalinux/host_vars* directory.
* Replace mentioning of the *x86_64* with architecture of your choice in the **hosts.yml** in the *inventories/almalinux* directory
:::

#### Setting Ansible to build ISOs for several architectures 
    
By default, the Ansible inventory is set to build an ISO for one architecture. But it's also possible to build ISOs for several architectures of your choice. To do so, please, make these changes:
* Make copies of the mentioned below files and rename them according to the required architecture:
    * **x86_64.yml** in the *inventories/almalinux/group_vars* directory
    * **x86_64.yml**, **x86_64-al8.yml**, **x86_64-al9.yml** files in the *inventories/almalinux/host_vars* directory.
* Add required architecture as parameters to the **hosts.yml** file in the *inventories/almalinux* directory. Don't forget to fill in the necessary parameters.
    
#### Setting Ansible to build an ISO for one AlmaLinux OS version

By default, the inventory is set to build ISOs for both AlmaLinux OS 8 and AlmaLinux OS 9 versions. What do we do to build for only one of them? You need to edit and comment items in several configuration files. 

* Go the the *inventories/almalinux/group_vars/* directory and edit the **all.yml** file. Comment one of the **sshd_ports_in_containers** options accordingly to your needs:
  ```bash
    ---
    sshd_ports_in_containers: # lists possible AlmaLinux OS versions for building ISOs
      8: 6023 # AlmaLinux OS 8, comment this line if you don't want to build this version
      9: 6022 # AlmaLinux OS 9, comment this line if you don't want to build this version
   ```

* In the same directory edit the **hosts.yml** file. Comment lines with AlmaLinux OS version that you don't need to build an ISO for:
  ```bash  
   ---
   os_versions:
     - 8
     - 9
   per_version_absent_repos:
     8:
       - "crb"
     9:
       - "powertools"
   products:
     - platform: "AlmaLinux-8"
       name: "almalinux8-beta"
       version: 8
     - platform: "AlmaLinux-9"
       name: "AlmaLinux-9-beta"
       version: 9
  ```

* Switch to the *inventories/almalinux/hosts.yml* directory and comment a docker host in the **hosts.yml** and its variables for the architecture you don't need. For example, if you don't want to build an AlmaLinux OS 9 ISO image for the x86_64 architecture, you should comment the *x86_64-al9* host and its variables *ansible_*:
  ```bash
    all:
      children:
        hosts:
          hosts:
            x86_64:
        dockers:
          children:
            x86_64-dockers:
        x86_64:
          hosts:
            x86_64:
              ansible_host: "<IP/domain/ssh alias>"
              ansible_user: "<a host user>"
          children:
            x86_64-dockers:
              hosts:
                x86_64-al8: # comment these lines if you don't need to build ISOs for AlmaLinux OS 8
                  ansible_host: "<IP/domain/ssh alias>"  # the same as a host machine
                  ansible_user: "root"
                  ansible_port: "{{ sshd_ports_in_containers[8] }}"
                x86_64-al9: # comment these lines if you don't need to build ISOs for AlmaLinux OS 9
                  ansible_host: "<IP/domain/ssh alias>"  # the same as a host machine
                  ansible_user: "root"
                  ansible_port: "{{ sshd_ports_in_containers[9] }}"
  ```

## Deployment

* After you set your Ansible inventory to meet your needs, deploy the Pungi node by running the following command:
  ```bash
  ansible-playbook -i inventories/almalinux playbooks/build_node_in_docker.yml -vv -b
  ```
* After the deployment it's recommended to check that you can connect successfully through SSH to each deployed Docker container. 
* Now you can sync RPM packages to a local mirror by running the following command:
  ```bash
  systemctl start reposync.<arch>.service
  ```
  :::warning
  In the command replace the **arch** part with the architecture you are building an ISO for. For example, x86_64:
  ```bash
  systemctl start reposync.x86_64.service
  ```
  :::
    
  Please, note, that the first sync can take up to several hours.  

## Building an AlmaLinux ISO
    
When the sync stage is completed you can proceed with building an ISO:

* Clone GitHub repository [pungi-scripts-public](https://github.com/AlmaLinux/pungi-scripts-public) into the previously deployed Docker container. 
* Switch to the *pungi-scripts-public/build_scripts* directory. 
* To build an ISO run the following command with options that meet your needs: 
  ```
  python3.9 jenkins.py --working-root-directory <working_root_directory> --arch <arch> --product-name AlmaLinux  --distribution-major-version <major_version>  --distribution-minor-version <minor_version> --beta-suffix <beta_suffix> --sigkeys-fingerprints <fingerprint_1> <fingerprint_2> --git-auth-token <git_auth_token> --git-auth-username <git_auth_username>
  ```
  Command options that you need to fill:
  * **working_root_directory** - specify your work directory as you did in the very beginning in the *inventories/almalinux/host_vars/x86_64.yml* file 
  * **arch** - specify what architecture you are building an ISO for, for example, *x86_64*
  * **major_version** and **minor_version** - set the numbers that match a full version of the distribution, for example in **8.9** - 8 is a major version, and 9 is a minor version
  * **beta_suffix** - this parametr can take two values, *-beta* and empty string *""*. Please, check the [pungi-almalinux](https://git.almalinux.org/almalinux/pungi-almalinux) repository as it contains branches with the same version and the same beta suffix.
  * **fingerprint_1** and **fingerprint_2** - these parameters are fingerprints of keys that are used to sign RPM packages.
      * For AlmaLinux OS 9:`B7BB94F0C9BA6CAA` and `D36CB86CB86B3716`
      * For AlmaLinux OS 8: `51D6647EC21AD6EA` and `488FCF7C3ABB34F8`
  * **git_auth_token** and **git_auth_username** - parameters for your auth credits that can be found at [git.almalinux.org](https://git.almalinux.org/explore/repos). To generate a token go to the [user settings/applications](https://git.almalinux.org/user/settings/applications)
    
:::tip
Please, note, that building an AlmaLinux ISO can take up to several hours, not including the time for syncing RPM packages to a local mirror.
