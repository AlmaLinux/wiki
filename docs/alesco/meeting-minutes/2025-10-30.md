## Decisions Adopted

## Minutes

Discussed [RFC: Provide Secure Boot-Signed Alternative Kernels](https://github.com/AlmaLinux/ALESCo/pull/15)  
- Providing multiple kernels isn't practical. We need to choose one kernel, most likely between the CentOS Hyperscale SIG and ELrepo Mainline kernels.

Discussed [proc: fix a dentry lock race between release_task and lookup](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/d919a1e79bac890421537cf02ae773007bf55e6b) upstream kernel patch
- Red Hat issue was created: https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-124568 (no activity so far)
- Backported patch should be submitted to CS9 according to https://sigs.centos.org/hyperscale/contributing/kernel-rhel/

Discussed including of virtio-win into AlmaLinux:
- Currently it's not included because it contains Red Hat built binaries and it's not clear if we can redistrubute them. Neal Gompa will help to find this out.

Discussed policy for adding new ALESCo members:
- Andrew Lukoshko will work on the policy draft.
- Neal Gompa will help with questionnaire for candidates.
