## Decisions Adopted

## Minutes

- Microsoft wants us to backport mainline kernel changes for Hyper-V into AlmaLinux stock kernel. ALESCo decided we should not backport any changes before they appear in CentOS Stream kernel. If they're not there yet we should try to create merge request. Each change request from MS must be considered individually.
- We have request to add virtio-win package to AlmaLinux 9 and 10. Currently it's not included because it contains Red Hat built binaries and it's not clear if we can redistrubute them. Neal Gompa will help to find this out.
