### Rebuilding EPEL for x86_64 v2
- Discussed pending draft RFC (https://hackmd.io/5__7wEQXS42L-ZdX9AFuPQ#) written by Jonathan and Neal.
    - Andrew: we should pull from directly from src.fedoraproject.org and not include any patches, ever.  If a build fails, send patch upstream to EPEL.
        - Neal/Jonathan strongly agreed.
        - This ensures we do not accidentally fork EPEL.
    - Andrew to update implementation plan so the RFC can be officially submitted.
    - RFC submission expected this week.
