## Decisions Adopted
1. AlmaLinux 10's default x86_64 microarchitecture build will be v3, following RHEL.  Approved building and maintaining x86_64_v2 as a separate architecture for AlmaLinux 10.
    - Unanimous decision.
2. AlmaLinux 10 will have frame pointers enabled, diverging from RHEL 10 which will not have frame pointers.
    - Unanimous decision
3. AlmaLinux will publish a rolling-style distro build, serving as a continuous beta release, starting with AlmaLinux 10.
    - Unanimous decision

## Minutes
- ALESCo Logistics
  - Items:
    - Meeting times
    - Recording
    - Meeting chat (public?, live?)
    - Where to publish: minutes, recordings (GitHub repository, wiki, etc)
    - Issue tracker (GH repo?)
    - Policy/procedure documentation
  - Will be discussing further via chat channels
- RHEL moving to x86_64 v3 microarchitecture in version 10
  - Some older hardware becomes unsupported
  - Improved performance
  - Community has voiced concerns with RHEL's decision on social media
    - CERN and other labs have voiced concerns
  - AlmaLinux will build a maintain a separate x86_64_v2 release.  v3 will be the default.
  - Package naming is TBD.  RHEL is using x86_64 for v3 which is incorrect, they should use x86_64_v3
    - Will have discussions with them at FLOCK about this
      - We'd like to follow RHEL's direction as our upstream, so we hope to talk with them about using the architecture tagging properly.
    - AlmaLinux v2 builds will use x86_64_v2 tags
      - Andrew & team working on patching various applications in the RPM stack to support this within AlmaLinux
        - Can potentially PR this work upstream to help convince RHEL to use the proper _v3 naming within RHEL 10
  - Enable frame pointers in AlmaLinux 10 builds
    - Most competing distros are enabling them now
    - Negligible performance impact
        - Loss of a register affects x86 32bit, legacy hardware take a noticeable hit
    - Allows continuous real-time profiling for "cheap"
    - Fedora enabled them several versions ago with no complaints after enablement
    - Especially useful in HPC
    - CentOS Hyperscale SIG considering enabling it by default
    - Do we offer non-frame pointer builds
  - Rolling release build for AlmaLinux 10
    - Serves as continous beta release
    - Will run full composes at least twice-yearly
    - Package updates will be a constant flow
    - Separate mirror source/repo on infra side
    - We're doing this already for AlmaLinux 10 development, just not currently publishing the resulting builds in a repoitory/as an OS
    - Not a replacement for point releases
    - We have to be mindful of security releases/patches from upstream
    - OpenQA to test all of the builds
    - Build in-line with point release (ex, frame pointers enabled)
