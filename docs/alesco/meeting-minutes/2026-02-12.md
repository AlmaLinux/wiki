## Minutes

Discussed [RFC: Provide Secure Boot-Signed Alternative Kernels](https://github.com/AlmaLinux/ALESCo/pull/15)

- The discussion will continue in the pull request comments. We also need to make sure the community needs this.

Discussed [proc: fix a dentry lock race between release_task and lookup](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/d919a1e79bac890421537cf02ae773007bf55e6b) upstream kernel patch

- Last activity in [https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-124568](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-124568) happened 2026-01-10:

```
Ok, so there appears to have been a reported regression that maybe related to a VFS locking problem.
The discussion talks about the patch proposed here which, IIUC, helps (with an additional small change) but doesn't resolve the problem.
Eric Sandeen has asked Al Viro to look at the problem and we are waiting on feedback from Al.
Unfortunately, until we work through that problem this one must wait.
```

- The backported patch has been submitted to CS9: https://gitlab.com/redhat/centos-stream/src/kernel/centos-stream-9/-/merge_requests/7769. No activity there either.

Discussed upstream fix for socat: [Handle EAGAIN on recvmsg()](https://gitlab.com/redhat/centos-stream/rpms/socat/-/merge_requests/13)

- Will vote for inclusion into AlmaLinux 9 on the ALESCo public chat channel.

Discussed policy for adding new ALESCo members:

- We're waiting for a questionnaire from Neal Gompa.
