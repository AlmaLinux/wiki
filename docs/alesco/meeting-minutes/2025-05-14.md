## Minutes

### Enable KVM on PPC64LE (RFC [#0002](https://github.com/AlmaLinux/ALESCo/pull/3))
- PPC64LE KVM packages work; OpenStack Nova/PPC libvirt issues
- Outcome: RFC accepted unanimously.

### NVIDIA Open-Source Driver (RFC [#0004](https://github.com/AlmaLinux/ALESCo/pull/8))
- Packaging complete; kernel-module signing almost finished.
- negativo17 (https://negativo17.org/nvidia-driver/) repo will serve until official NVIDIA repo appears. Have discussed w/ them.
- Outcome: RFC accepted unanimously.
- Actions:
    - Neal to finish signing workflow.
    - Jonathan to coordinate with NVIDIA’s Simone about repo hand-off

### Enable CRB by Default in AlmaLinux 10 (RFC [#0006](https://github.com/AlmaLinux/ALESCo/pull/10))
- Motivation: SELinux-policy split will break EPEL without CRB.
- Pros: smoother UX; already on in RHEL containers.
- Cons: diverges from vanilla RHEL; minor metadata hit
- Outcome: Vote postponed to next meeting.
- Actions:
    - All members to seek concrete breakage scenarios.

### Btrfs Tech Preview (RFC [#0005](https://github.com/AlmaLinux/ALESCo/pull/9))
- CentOS Stream Hyperscale patches exist; installer already patched.
- Concerns: long-term KABI drift, but Stream gives early warning.
- Outcome: Approved for “Kitten” branch only; async vote later for 10 GA.
- Actions:
  - Enable for Kitten, see how it goes to help determine if we consider it for 10 GA

### Use dynamic workspace indicator on GNOME (RFC [#0003](https://github.com/AlmaLinux/ALESCo/pull/6))
- Goal: keep workspace-dots indicator and add AlmaLinux logo to the left.
- Needs a new patch; no vote yet.
- Action: Elkhan & Neal (with help from Javi) to draft PoC/patch
