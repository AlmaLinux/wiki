## Decisions Adopted

## Minutes

Discussed [RFC: Provide Secure Boot-Signed Alternative Kernels](https://github.com/AlmaLinux/ALESCo/pull/15)  
Here are some comments that should be addressed in the RFC:
- Do we need to maintain modifications on our side or build it as is?
- Which repo(s) should the kernels be released to?
- Unresolved Questions should be clarified
- Kernel testing should be clarified, at least some proposals should be in the RFC.
- Proposal Owners should be updated to match the real SIGs' responsibilities.
- Remove "NVIDIA Kmods" from the RFC because it's unlikely the NVIDIA driver will always work with mainline kernels.
