# Frequently asked questions


### What is AlmaLinux?

AlmaLinux is a 1:1 binary compatible fork of RHEL.


### Can I do X, Y, or Z with AlmaLinux?

If currently possible in either RHEL or CentOS, the answer is yes.
Unless RHEL dramatically shifts development direction, our response
will continue to be yes.


### Intended user

Anyone who currently relies on the CentOS stable release to achieve computing
objectives. Individuals and organizations that require an enterprise-grade,
Fedora-like distribution but who do not want to or cannot pay for a RHEL
license.


### Why is it called _AlmaLinux_?

Alma means soul in Spanish and other Latin languages. A vital part
of Linux is the passionate, diverse developer community either helping
support the work of Linux and other essential activities that advance Linux.
This community is the soul of Linux, and Linux distribution users are indebted
to the Linux community's efforts. We chose the name AlmaLinux in homage to the
Linux community.


### How is the community protected from future development roadmap changes?

We involve the community right through the process, including in the
governing board. AlmaLinux will always be free and open-source. The community
can select the project at any time.


### Why use CloudLinux's CentOS alternative?

Our core product, the CloudLinux OS, is a RHEL fork that has been in place
for over ten years. More than 4,000 companies, including Dell, Liquid Web,
and 1&1, rely on the CloudLinux OS across more than 200,000 product
installations. CloudLinux has proven experience in creating and maintaining
a RHEL fork and have done so starting with RHEL release 5, right through to
release 8. AlmaLinux is an opportunity for us to channel our expertise in
RHEL into a Linux distribution that serves the broader community.
Furthermore, we include the Linux community right from the inception
of AlmaLinux. Moving forward, community members will be on the governing
board for the AlmaLinux project and involved in critical decisions. Finally,
AlmaLinux will always be free and open source. The community can pick up
and continue to develop AlmaLinux at any time.


### How do I migrate a single host from CentOS to AlmaLinux?

We will provide a single command to swap repositories and keys once the beta
version is released.


### How do I migrate an entire fleet of servers from CentOS to AlmaLinux?

As stated, AlmaLinux will be a 1:1 binary compatible fork of RHEL, which
means that your applications and services will remain interoperable. For that
reason, you can rapidly migrate any number of servers with just one command.


### How long will CloudLinux support AlmaLinux?

CloudLinux is committed to supporting AlmaLinux until 2029, including stable
and thoroughly tested updates and security patches. Read more about CloudLinux
support in the [CloudLinux announcement]
