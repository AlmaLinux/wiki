| Testing                 | Content in the Testing repository includes updates that require additional testing before they are released to stable repositories. **Please, note, that it's _NOT_ recommended to install packages from the Testing repo on production machines.**                                 | # dnf install almalinux-release-testing             | # dnf install almalinux-release-testing             |
| Devel                   | Content in the Devel repo includes packages that are not normally provided in the base nor extra repositories, but needed for build-time dependencies of other packages. **Devel is _NOT_ meant to satisfy runtime dependencies or for long term use on general purpose machines.** | # dnf install almalinux-release-devel               | # dnf install almalinux-release-devel               |

AlmaLinux has a [Vault](http://repo.almalinux.org/vault/) repository that provides packages and isos for previous AlmaLinux OS versions. Also, the Vault repository contains 32-bit packages for the latest stable version to build. Vault and other AlmaLinux repositories are available on [repo.almalinux.org](http://repo.almalinux.org/).
