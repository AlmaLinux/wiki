# CentOS SIGs Repositories

CentOS Special Interest Groups (SIGs) are smaller groups within the CentOS community that focus on a small set of issues, in order to either create awareness or to focus on development along a specific topic. SIGs are often very popular and used quite frequently by the community. AlmaLinux has decided to make upstream CentOS SIGs usable from within AlmaLinux for the community's benefit. We encourage contributors interested in SIG development to work upstream and submit contributions there. 

:::warning
Since CentOS 8 Stream has reached its End-Of-Life, corresponding CentOS SIGs packages for AlmaLinux OS 8 are no longer valid and have been removed from the list.

## Cloud SIG

The [Cloud SIG](https://wiki.centos.org/SpecialInterestGroup/Cloud) focuses on issues around running Cloud Infrastructure / Hypervisor 
for on-premise clouds as well as supports other SIGs and projects looking to consume some of the shared resources around on-premise cloud infra.
