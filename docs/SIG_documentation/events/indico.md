title: 'Managing events.almalinux.org'
---

Our events are managed using Indico, the open source software created and developed at CERN. Our install, at events.almalinux.org, is kept up to date by the AlmaLinux Infra SIG, but events on it are managed by the Marketing SIG. This document helps us when creating new events, so we are consistent with what delivering to the community.

# Creating different events

When creating different types of events, it's important that you follow the directions below so that our community can count on events being presented in a consistent way. 

All events should start as unlisted events, and will be published after they're peer-reviewed.

## Webinars

1. Create a 'Lecture' type event
1. After it's created, edit the event and add the description (including the default text below)
1. Ensure that the time is right for the displayed timezone.
1. Add speakers who are not yet registered for the event (note for benny: if they register later, what happens?)
1. under 'Protection' allow public registration
1. under 'Organisation - > Participants' set the visibility to the default of "Show only consenting participants" and click save, so that the registration form will be displayed.
1. Edit the form 
1. under 'Organisation - > Reminders' add a reminder to send immediately to all participants with the icalendar file
1. under 'Organisation - > Reminders' add a reminder relative to the event start time at 1 day offset from the event, sent to all participants and all speakers, sent from 'noreply@almalinux.org', including the event description
