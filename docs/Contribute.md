# Contributing to the AlmaLinux project

AlmaLinux OS development, infrastructure management, and overall project promotion are organized using our community chat. There are many ways to contribute to AlmaLinux OS - testing, quality assurance, documentation, and more. We'd love to welcome you! To help get you started, here is a Q&A video on the subject:

**And here are some ideas to get you going:**

How you or your team can contribute their time: 
- Content Creation: Create engaging content around interesting projects which showcase the use of AlmaLinux
- ELevate - assist in expanding ELevate capabilities (migrations from additional versions), adding PES data for packages
- Improve or expand documentation on our wiki
- Become part of the infrastructure team for AlmaLinux – help maintain AlmaLinux core infrastructure, including build, test & mirror infrastructure
- Become part of the security team for AlmaLinux - help define security architecture, maintain periodic audits and log reviews, etc.
- Become part of the AlmaLinux build team - work on rebuilding RHEL packages, and building packages requested by the community. Assist in packing for EPEL.
- Expert help - help users on our Mailing List, Mattermost chat & Reddit
- Events staffing - represent AlmaLinux at LUG & Linux / OpenSource conferences - when they are geographically close to your location
- Help with AlmaLinux branding - Web design, graphical design - almalinux.org website (Hugo!), swag or sticker design
- Help get AlmaLinux through Common Criteria certification - CIS Benchmark and STIGs 
- Participate in the development of build platform, mirror platform - or any other part of the infrastructure (Python, JavaScript)
- Improve or expand the translations of the AlmaLinux website


If your company benefits from the existence of AlmaLinux, consider sponsoring AlmaLinux enabling all of the work we do across the world!

## Help with reporting bugs and making fixes

Since AlmaLinux aims to be as close to RHEL as possible, it should have nearly identical bugs as the current release of RHEL. AlmaLinux recommends following an "upstream first" approach in order to help not just the AlmaLinux but the whole EL community:
* Try to reproduce the steps and check whether the bug is present in CentOS Stream or has been already fixed.
* If present, it means that the bug is upstream. Please, submit the bug to [CentOS Stream bugzilla](https://wiki.centos.org/ReportBugs) providing all the necessary information about an issue and reproducing steps. This is the contribution path to get the bug fix into the upstream, which will, in turn, be built into AlmaLinux.
* If you are able to help investigate and fix the bug, please collaborate with CentOS Stream, as this is the best an AlmaLinux Community Member can do. Check the [CentOS Contributor's Guide](https://docs.centos.org/en-US/stream-contrib/) for more details.
* If the bug is AlmaLinux-specific, please open a bug on [AlmaLinux Bug Tracker](https://bugs.almalinux.org/) providing all the necessary information about an issue and reproducing steps. 

Please, file your [bugs](https://github.com/AlmaLinux/almalinux-deploy/issues) and join us for discussions on [GitHub](https://github.com/AlmaLinux/almalinux-deploy/discussions) and on [AlmaLinux Chat on Mattermost](https://chat.almalinux.org/).

## Specific Areas We Need Help With 

Each SIG has their own specific focus areas that are looking for help, but here are some more general ones!

### 1.  Help with reporting bugs and making fixes

To make AlmaLinux successful, we need the close involvement of the community members. We use our bug tracking system to find, track, and fix bugs. We encourage AlmaLinux users to help us by filling in bug-reports. You can track and discuss all bugs on [bugs.almalinux.org](https://bugs.almalinux.org/).

### 2. Improve the documentation

The importance of documentation cannot be understated, as it is like an investment in the future. It can take time and energy, but it is essential to create full and comprehensive documentation together.

If you want to participate, please, follow the [guidelines](Contribute-to-Documentation).

### 3. Help with Azure mirrors deployment

We want to make sure that AlmaLinux images in Azure Cloud will use local mirrors for each region, and don't pay for traffic. More info [here](/cloud/Azure).

### 4. Promotion, blog posts, translations, and more!

If you are looking to flex skills not directly involved in development, we are always looking for guest blog posts, help with translations of our website, folks to staff events, and much more! Reach out in the [Marketing](https://chat.almalinux.org/almalinux/channels/marketing) channel for more info!

### 5. More ways to help for DevOps & Programmers
