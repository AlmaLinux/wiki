# Help translating the site

The [almaLinux.org websites](https://almalinux.org/) localization and translation is managed by [Weblate](https://hosted.weblate.org/engage/almalinux/) and supported by contributors, the translations that get submitted through Weblate are automatically submitted to the [almaLinux.org repo](https://github.com/AlmaLinux/almalinux.org) as a pull request.

> Pull requests are reviewed by a member of the marketing SIG or another team lead, and merged as appropriate.

## Create an account

First you need to create a [Weblate](https://hosted.weblate.org/accounts/register/) account, you could use accounts from other service providers or fill in the form shown below to create it.

## Starting to translate

After creating an account we need to head to [AlmaLinux Foundation Weblate](https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/almalinux/):

Choosing each one of the two should send you to a page similar to the image below.

Then choose the language you want to translate to. For this example, I'll choose [Hebrew](https://hosted.weblate.org/translate/almalinux/website-backend/he/?q=state:%3Ctranslated).

After translating from English to your chosen language (.e.g Hebrew) press on "Save and continue" and your translation will be sent eventually as a PR to the [almalinux.org repo](https://github.com/AlmaLinux/almalinux.org) and reviewed by a member of the marketing SIG or another team lead, then merged as appropriate.

##  Request new languages 

You can request new languages to be added by creating a ticket in [GitHub issues](https://github.com/AlmaLinux/almalinux.org/issues), like so:
