# Media & Entertainment SIG

## Special Interest Group for Visual Effects, Animation, Post-Production and other Media & Entertainment fields.

The AlmaLinux Media & Entertainment SIG is a Special Interest Group dedicated to supporting and enhancing the use of AlmaLinux within the professional visual effects, animation, and post-production industries. 

Our mission is to ensure AlmaLinux becomes the trusted, production-ready Linux platform for studios of all sizes by serving as the central hub for collaboration between artists, engineers, and open-source developers. We will work to ensure AlmaLinux is the trusted, production-ready Linux platform for studios large and small, while contributing patches, documentation, and reference architectures back to the AlmaLinux ecosystem.

### How to Join

Joining is easy! You can:
Show up to a SIG meeting

Pick up an issue from our tracker by assigning it to yourself

Ask questions and get involved in our chat space

Not every contributor wants to be a member of the SIG, but if you do, participation is straightforward and always welcome.

### Where we chat

We use Mattermost (link TBD) for communication. Discussions also occur on the AlmaLinux mailing list: lists.almalinux.org.

### Where and when we meet

The Media & EntertainmentSIG will hold monthly meetings on the first Wednesday of each month at 16:00 UTC.
This time was chosen to accommodate members across Europe and Canada — aligning with late afternoon in Europe and mid-morning to midday across Canadian time zones.
Meetings are open to all and will be held virtually through the AlmaLinux community platform.

### Activities, projects, and deliverables

The Media & EntertainmentSIG will focus on:
Certification & compatibility: Ensuring Media & Entertainment industry-standard tools (Nuke, Houdini, Maya, Blender, etc.) run smoothly on AlmaLinux.

Reference builds: Providing guides for configuring workstations, render nodes, and storage systems.

Studio workflows: Documentation for hybrid and on-prem Media & Entertainment pipelines (storage, networking, render farms).

Best practices: Security hardening, performance tuning, and reliability guidelines for production environments.

Community contributions: Packaging, testing, and bug reporting related to Media & Entertainment software.

### Help wanted

We welcome contributions of all shapes and sizes! Areas where help is needed:
Packaging: Assist in building and packaging ASWF projects into RPMs and Creating automation playbooks for render farms, storage, and pipeline tools for AlmaLinux
Testing: Run validation tests, Benchmarking and publishing performance data for hardware and workloads projects to ensure stability and compatibility with other Media & Entertainment / Animation software on AlmaLinux and reporting issues.
Documentation: Write guides on how to install, configure, and integrate these projects into studio pipelines and transitions to AlmaLinux.
Bug Reporting: Identify and report bugs specifically related to running ASWF software on AlmaLinux.
Upstream Collaboration: Work with the upstream ASWF project teams to contribute patches and provide feedback from the AlmaLinux community.

### Additional information for SIG application approval

Timeline
Q1 2026 Official kickoff, initial focus on documenting AlmaLinux workstation and render farm configurations.

Mid to late - 2026: Publication of reference architectures and compatibility guidelines for Media & Entertainment studios.

### Resources

Infrastructure: A Mattermost channel, mailing list, and GitHub space under AlmaLinux.

### Funding

None required at this stage, though future sponsorship may be requested for industry outreach (e.g., SIGGRAPH presence or licensing to test softwares).

### Why now

The Media & Entertainment industry is experiencing significant disruption due to recent licensing and support changes from established platform providers. This has created a clear and urgent demand for a stable, open-source, and enterprise-grade Linux distribution that studios can rely on. AlmaLinux is perfectly positioned to fill this gap.
This SIG will act as the crucial bridge between the AlmaLinux community and the M&E industry. We will ensure the needs of studios, artists, and engineers are not just heard, but are actively documented, addressed, and integrated into the AlmaLinux ecosystem, guaranteeing it is the trusted, long-term platform for production pipelines.
