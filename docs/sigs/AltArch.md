# AltArch SIG

The purpose of this SIG is to maintain support for alternate (non-mainstream) architectures like x86_32 and Raspberry Pi.
This SIG will work in close collaboration with the Core SIG to ensure all builds remain synchronized with the AlmaLinux OS 10 releases and maintains compatibility with RHEL ecosystem standards.

## How to Join

Joining is easy! You can show up to a meeting, pick up an issue from the list by assigning it to yourself, or ask questions in chat! Not every contributor wants to be a part of the SIG, but if you do, joining is simple.

**Where we chat**

The AltArch SIG uses [AltArch](https://chat.almalinux.org/almalinux/channels/sigaltarch) chat channel for communication.

**Where and when we meet**

Meetings will be held bi-weekly, with timing adjusted to accommodate members across different time zones. We also work asynchronously in Mattermost to accomplish our goals between meetings.

## Activities, projects, and deliverables

- Maintain synchronization with AlmaLinux 10 minor releases
- Security patch backporting and testing
- Community support for platforms like x86_32 and Raspberry Pi
- Maintain selected packages from the epel 10 repository for alternate archs

### Help wanted

Contributions take all kinds of shapes and sizes, and we welcome everyone! If you have expertise or time and would like to help us out, please join us at [AltArch SIG on Mattermost](https://chat.almalinux.org/almalinux/channels/sigaltarch)
