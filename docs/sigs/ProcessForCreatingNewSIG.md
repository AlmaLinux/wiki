# The Process for Creating a New SIG* in the AlmaLinux Community 
*Special Interest Group


## Abstract

> This document outlines the process and additional considerations for creating a new Special Interest Group (SIG) within the AlmaLinux community, fostering collaboration, innovation, and growth. This process aims to facilitate successful SIG creation and integration within the AlmaLinux ecosystem. SIGs are essential for bringing together individuals and organizations with common interests to work on specific projects, develop new features, or address particular issues within the AlmaLinux project. Incorporating insights from Fedora and CentOS, such as mentorship and collaboration with existing SIGs, periodic evaluation for continuous improvement, and guidelines for SIG decommissioning, this process is designed to help individuals and organizations contribute effectively to the continued success of the AlmaLinux project and shape its future.


## Scope

This process is applicable to any individual or organization within the AlmaLinux community who wishes to establish a new SIG.


## Procedure


### 1. Proposal Submission

To initiate the process of creating a new SIG, a proposal must be submitted to the AlmaLinux Foundation Board. The proposal should include:

a. A clear and concise title for the SIG.

b. An overview of the SIG's objectives and goals.

c. A list of initial members, including at least one SIG Chair.

d. A detailed description of the SIG's intended activities and projects.

e. A proposed timeline for achieving the SIG's objectives.

f. Any required resources, such as infrastructure or funding.


### 2. Proposal Review

Upon receiving a proposal, the AlmaLinux Foundation Board will review the submission to ensure it aligns with the project's goals and values. The review process includes:

a. Assessing the proposal's relevance to the AlmaLinux ecosystem.

b. Evaluating the clarity and feasibility of the SIG's objectives and activities.

c. Reviewing the qualifications of the proposed SIG Chair and initial members.


### 3. Feedback and Revision

If the proposal requires modifications or additional information, the AlmaLinux Foundation Board will provide feedback to the proposer. The proposer will then have the opportunity to revise and resubmit the proposal, addressing the feedback provided.


### 4. Approval and Announcement

Once the proposal has been reviewed and deemed acceptable, the AlmaLinux Foundation Board will formally approve the creation of the new SIG. The approval will be announced through appropriate communication channels, such as mailing lists, forums, and social media. The announcement will include:

a. The title and objectives of the new SIG.

b. The names of the SIG Chair and initial members.

c. A link to the SIG's dedicated webpage or communication platform.

d. An invitation for interested community members to join the SIG.


### 5. SIG Formation

Following the announcement, the new SIG will:

a. Establish a dedicated communication channel (e.g., mailing list, chat room, or forum) for members to collaborate and discuss SIG-related matters.

b. Create a public repository (if applicable) for storing and managing project resources and documentation.

c. Develop a roadmap and assign tasks to SIG members.


### 6. Reporting and Accountability

To maintain transparency and ensure progress towards the SIG's objectives, the SIG Chair will be responsible for:

a. Providing regular status updates to the AlmaLinux Foundation Board.

b. Ensuring that SIG activities adhere to the AlmaLinux project's guidelines and policies.

c. Coordinating the SIG's communication and collaboration with other SIGs and the broader AlmaLinux community.

## Additional Considerations


### A.1. Mentorship and Collaboration with Existing SIGs

To improve the integration of new SIGs within the AlmaLinux community, consider establishing a mentorship program where existing SIGs can offer guidance and assistance to newly-formed SIGs. This collaboration may include:

a. Sharing best practices and lessons learned from previous projects and initiatives.

b. Providing technical or organizational support in areas where the new SIG may lack expertise.

c. Facilitating joint projects or activities that can benefit both SIGs and foster collaboration within the community.


### A.2. Evaluation and Continuous Improvement

To ensure that SIGs continue to provide value and effectively contribute to the AlmaLinux ecosystem, introduce a periodic evaluation process. This process may involve:

a. Reviewing the progress and achievements of each SIG against their stated objectives and timelines.

b. Gathering feedback from SIG members and the broader AlmaLinux community on the performance and impact of the SIG.

c. Identifying areas for improvement and implementing changes to enhance the SIG's effectiveness and alignment with the community's goals.


### 


### A.3. SIG Decommissioning

In the event a SIG becomes inactive, no longer serves its intended purpose, or does not align with the community's objectives, outline a process for decommissioning the SIG. This may include:

a. Notifying the AlmaLinux Foundation Board of the intention to decommission the SIG.

b. Ensuring that all relevant documentation, resources, and knowledge are preserved and transferred to appropriate parties within the community.

c. Formally announcing the decommissioning of the SIG and providing a rationale for the decision.
