# The Process for Creating a New SIG* in the AlmaLinux Community 
*Special Interest Group

SIGs are the lifeblood for a healthy open source community, especially around an operating system. Joining a SIG is the first step that many newcomers to a community take, and standardizing the process around creating a SIG is important because it ensures that newcomers are met with similar information no matter which group they chose to start with. 

This document outlines the process and additional considerations for creating a new Special Interest Group (SIG) within the AlmaLinux OS community, fostering collaboration, innovation, and growth. This process aims to facilitate successful SIG creation and integration within the AlmaLinux ecosystem. SIGs are essential for bringing together individuals and organizations with common interests to work on specific projects, develop new features, or address particular issues within the AlmaLinux project. Incorporating insights from Fedora and CentOS, such as mentorship and collaboration with existing SIGs, periodic evaluation for continuous improvement, and guidelines for SIG decommissioning, this process is designed to help individuals and organizations contribute effectively to the continued success of the AlmaLinux project and shape its future.

### 0. Gauge interest

If you have an idea and want to see if there is interest in that idea, the first step is to gather a group of folks together that might want to work on that thing. You can do that by asking in the [chat](https://chat.almalinux.org), sending an email to the [users mailing list](https://lists.almalinux.org/mailman3/lists/users.lists.almalinux.org/), and posting on the [forums](https://forums.almalinux.org/). 

Once you have gathered a group (we recommend no fewer than 3, but that isn't true for every effort), it's time to start getting things lined up!

### 1. Write a proposal for the board

To create a new SIG, a proposal must be submitted to and approved by the AlmaLinux OS Foundation Board. To create the proposal, clone this repo, make a copy of the [template](https://wiki.almalinux.org/sigs/sigproposaltemplate.html) file, title it for your SIG, and start filling things in! Once you are satisfied with the content of your proposal, submit a pull request to the wiki, and tag @bennyvasquez. She'll take a look and let you know if there are any concerns. 

If none, she'll let you know the date of the board meeting at which your SIG proposal will be discussed! Members of the board or the community might comment and ask questions or provide feedback on your pull request ahead of the board meeting, so make sure to answer those questions as well as you can. At a minimum, your proposal should include:

<ol type="a">
  <li>A clear and concise name for the SIG.</li>
  <li>An overview of the SIG's objectives and goals.</li>
  <li>A list of initial members, including at least one SIG leader.</li>
  <li>A description of the SIG's intended activities and projects.</li>
  <li>A proposed timeline for achieving the SIG's initial objectives.</li>
  <li>Any known required resources, such as infrastructure or funding.</li>
</ol>

### 2. Proposal Review

The job of the AlmaLinux OS Foundation Board in this process is to review the submission to ensure it aligns with the project's goals and values. The review process includes:

<ol type="a">
  <li>Assessing the proposal's relevance to the AlmaLinux ecosystem.</li>
  <li>Evaluating the clarity and feasibility of the SIG's objectives and activities.</li>
  <li>Provide any insight or guidance that might be beneficial for the SIG.</li>
</ol>


### 3. Feedback and Revision

Though we hope to have provided all of the feedback ahead of time, if the board has additional thoughts about the proposal and requires modifications or additional information at the scheduled board meeting, the feedback will be provided to the proposers. The group of proposers will then have the opportunity to revise and resubmit the proposal, addressing the feedback provided.


### 4. Approval and Announcement

Once the proposal has been reviewed and deemed acceptable, the board will formally approve the creation of the new SIG, and the pull request will be merged into the wiki. The approval will be announced by the marketing SIG through appropriate communication channels, such as mailing lists, forums, and social media. The announcement will include:

<ol type="a">
  <li>The title and objectives of the new SIG.</li>
  <li>A link to the SIG's wiki page.</li>
  <li>An invitation for interested community members to join the SIG.</li>
</ol>


### 5. Reporting and Accountability

To maintain transparency and ensure progress towards the SIG's objectives, the SIG Chair will be responsible for:

<ol type="a">
  <li>Providing regular status updates to the AlmaLinux OS Foundation Board.</li>
  <li>Ensuring that SIG activities adhere to the AlmaLinux project's guidelines and policies.</li>
  <li>Coordinating the SIG's communication and collaboration with other SIGs and the broader AlmaLinux community</li>
</ol>


## Additional Considerations


### A.1. Mentorship and Collaboration with Existing SIGs

To improve the integration of new SIGs within the AlmaLinux community, consider establishing a mentorship program where existing SIGs can offer guidance and assistance to newly-formed SIGs. This collaboration may include:
<ol type="a">
  <li>Sharing best practices and lessons learned from previous projects and initiatives.</li>
  <li>Providing technical or organizational support in areas where the new SIG may lack expertise.</li>
  <li>Facilitating joint projects or activities that can benefit both SIGs and foster collaboration within the community.</li>
</ol>


### A.2. SIG Decommissioning

In the event a SIG becomes inactive, no longer serves its intended purpose, or does not align with the community's objectives, the SIG may mark itself (or be marked) as inactive, or may be decommissioned. This may include:

<ol type="a">
  <li>Notifying the board and the community of the intention to decommission the SIG.</li>
  <li>Ensuring that all relevant documentation, resources, and knowledge are preserved and transferred to appropriate parties within the community.</li>
  <li>Formally announcing the decommissioning of the SIG, updating the wiki page to reflect the decision and ideally providing a rationale for the decision.</li>
</ol>
