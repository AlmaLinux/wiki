## How to Join

Joining is easy! You can show up to a meeting, pick up an issue from the list by assigning it to yourself, or ask questions in chat! Not every contributor wants to be a part of the SIG, but if you do, joining is simple. 

**Where we chat**

The Migration SIG uses the [SIG/Migration](https://chat.almalinux.org/almalinux/channels/migration) chat channel for communication.

**Where and when we meet**

We do not currently hold regular meetings, but work asynchronously in mattermost to accomplish our goals.
