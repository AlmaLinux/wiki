# name of SIG

[insert the SIG's purpose here]

## How to Join

Joining is easy! You can show up to a meeting, pick up an issue from the list by assigning it to yourself, or ask questions in chat! Not every contributor wants to be a part of the SIG, but if you do, joining is simple. 

**Where we chat**

We use $platform for communication. [ this should either be a link to the SIG chat room on mattermost, or the mailing list on lists.almalinux.org ]

**Where and when we meet**

Meetings are... [ this should be a general day/time/cadence, and indicate how one might join this meeting if they'd like, or use "We do not currently hold regular meetings, but work asynchronously in mattermost to accomplish our goals." ]

## Activities, projects, and deliverables

[ this should be the thing or list of things you expect to be responsible for ]

### Help wanted

Contributions take all kinds of shapes and sizes, and we welcome everyone! If you have expertise or time and would like to help us out, here are a few things that need help soon, and a place where you can find more information.
