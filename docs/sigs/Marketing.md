# Marketing SIG

The Marketing team is responsible for AlmaLinux marketing and outreach efforts. Marketing is often an overlooked or eschewed term in open source, but without marketing efforts it's a whole lot harder for your audience to find you. We try to make it easy for the users who need a free enterprise linux distribution to find us.

## How to Join

Joining is easy! You can show up to a meeting, pick up an issue from the list by assigning it to yourself, or ask questions in chat! Not every contributor wants to be a part of the SIG, but if you do, joining is simple. 

**Where we chat**

We use the [~Marketing](https://chat.almalinux.org/almalinux/channels/marketing) channel for communication on the AlmaLinux mattermost server.

**Where/how we meet**

Meetings are every other Thursday on Google Meet at 9pm UTC. Join the Marketing channel on [chat.almalinux.org](https://chat.almalinux.org/almalinux/channels/marketing) and ask benny for the meeting invite! Our meeting notes are kept in [Google drive](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OK8mQSU-EucCT-VdFVOd87BECmVSXIKXkG7uhLubs9o/edit#heading=h.9ynhotw081jk).

### Help wanted

Contributions take all kinds of shapes and sizes, and we welcome everyone! If you have expertise or time and would like to help us out, here are a few things that need help soon, and a place where you can find more information.

* Mastodon automation - we use Sprout Social for scheduling ahead of time right now, but it doesn't work with mastodon! 
* Event management and staffing -- help us expand the number of events we can join by helping us staff events local to you!
* Content writers -- especially for the blog and social media
* Website maintainers -- our Hugo migration is complete, but we need to clean it up
* Graphic designers -- we have sticker ideas, but they aren't nearly as pretty as they could be!
* Website translations -- accepted through [Weblate](https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/almalinux/website-backend/), automatically sent to the website repo for merging in. 

We have tons of ideas and bugs on the [website repo](https://github.com/AlmaLinux/almalinux.org) and on [GitHub Projects](https://github.com/orgs/AlmaLinux/projects/5/views/1).
