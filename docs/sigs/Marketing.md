# Marketing SIG

The Marketing team is responsible for AlmaLinux branding consistency, marketing and outreach efforts, and overall public presense. Marketing is often an overlooked or eschewed term in open source, but without marketing efforts it's a whole lot harder for your audience to find you. We try to make it easy for the users who need a free enterprise linux distribution to find us.

## How to Join

Joining is easy! You can show up to a meeting, pick up an issue from the list by assigning it to yourself, or ask questions in chat! Not every contributor wants to be a part of the SIG, but if you do, joining is simple. 

**Where we chat**

We use the [~Marketing](https://chat.almalinux.org/almalinux/channels/marketing) channel for communication on the AlmaLinux mattermost server.

**Where/how we meet**

Meetings are every other Thursday on Google Meet at 9pm UTC. Join the Marketing channel on [chat.almalinux.org](https://chat.almalinux.org/almalinux/channels/marketing) and ask benny for the meeting invite! Our meeting notes are kept in [Google drive](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OK8mQSU-EucCT-VdFVOd87BECmVSXIKXkG7uhLubs9o/edit#heading=h.9ynhotw081jk).

### Help wanted

Contributions take all kinds of shapes and sizes, and we welcome everyone! If you have expertise or time and would like to help us out, here are a few things that need help soon, and a place where you can find more information.

* Event management and staffing -- help us expand the number of events we can join by helping us staff events local to you!
* Content writers -- especially for the blog and social media
* Website maintainers -- our Hugo migration is complete, but we need to clean it up
* Graphic designers -- we have stickers, but they aren't nearly as pretty as they could be! we have ideas, but execution is... lacking. :D 
* Website translations -- accepted through [Weblate](https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/almalinux/website-backend/), automatically sent to the website repo for merging in. To contribute, take a look at the ["Help translating site"](/Help-translating-site.html) guide.

We have tons of ideas and bugs on the [website repo](https://github.com/AlmaLinux/almalinux.org) and on [GitHub Projects](https://github.com/orgs/AlmaLinux/projects/5/views/1).
