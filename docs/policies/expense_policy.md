# AlmaLinux Expense and Reimbursement Policy

This policy was adopted by the Board of Directors via email in [January of 2026 (recorded in the notes of the February meeting)](/Transparency.html#minutes-of-almalinux-os-foundation-board-meetings).

### 1. Purpose

This policy establishes the procedure for reimbursing travel, accommodation, and other related expenses incurred by members, contributors, or employees of the AlmaLinux OS Foundation (Foundation) during conferences, events, or activities that align with the Foundation's mission.

---

### 2. Scope

This policy applies to:

- Foundation staff.

- Official contributors and volunteers.

- Board members.

- Other individuals who are authorized to travel on behalf of the Foundation.

---

### 3. General Principles

- Expenses must be reasonable, necessary, and directly related to the mission of the Foundation.

- Prior approval for travel must usually be obtained before incurring any expenses. Expenses at claimant's risk otherwise.

- Reimbursement will be based on actual costs and must usually be supported by receipts.

---

### 4. Pre-Travel Approval

While you may apply for reimbursement without pre-approval, there is a significant risk that your claim might be denied or reduced. If you wish to avoid this, please seek pre-approval.

1.  Request Process

- Submit a Travel Request Form to the Travel Budget Administrator (expenses@almalinux.org) 14 days prior to travel, unless there is a defensible reason for not doing so.

- Include details of the event, purpose, estimated costs, and expected outcomes.

3.  Approval

- Approval must be provided in writing by the Board Secretary.

---

### 5. Eligible Expenses

In general, the foundation will reimburse reasonable choices of publicly available transport by any means, or private transport that is less expensive. The Foundation will reimburse at least the following expenses:

#### 5.1 Travel

5.1.1 Airfare & Rail & Bus

- Economy class tickets only, apart from cases of genuine need or of benefit to the Foundation agreed with the approver in advance. Upgrades are at the traveler's personal expense. Reasonable luggage and seating charges are permitted.

- Use the most cost-effective and direct route.

5.1.2 Ground Transportation

- Public transport, ride-shares, or taxis. To the extent a receipt is not available for public transportation, these expenses should be documented by screenshots or affidavits.

- Personal car use (see 5.1.3 below for details).

- Rental cars when more economical than other transport modes. Actual costs must be claimed and not mileage.

5.1.3 Personal Vehicle Use

- If traveling to a conference or event using a personal car, mileage will be reimbursed at the current IRS mileage rate (or equivalent local government rate for international travelers).

- Mileage reimbursement covers fuel, wear and tear, and insurance costs, so these may not be claimed separately.

- Submit a mileage log including:

- Starting location.

- Destination.

- Purpose of the trip.

- Total miles driven (round trip).

Additional Car-Related Reimbursable Expenses:

- Parking fees at the airport, event or hotel.

- Toll/congestion charges incurred during travel. Please pay directly, since we do not usually reimburse rental company service fees for toll management.

- Permit fees (e.g. Austrian "Maut", Swiss "Vignette" etc)

Non-Reimbursable Car Expenses:

- Routine maintenance, insurance premiums, or traffic/parking violations.

5.1.4 Travel by any other method

Generally, the foundation prefers the most cost-effective and reasonable method of travel. Any non-commercial airline, driving, or train travel is discouraged. However, if alternate transportation is chosen, we will reimburse up to the cost of a commercial flight booked at a reasonable time before the event.

#### 5.2 Accommodation

- Reasonable hotel costs (standard rooms only) at or near the event venue.  "Reasonable" usually means at or below the General Services Administration (GSA) or US State Department per diem rates, both plus 30%. When there are no suitable hotels within a reasonable distance of an event venue more expensive options may be approved on a case-by-case basis.

#### 5.3 Meals

- You may claim the per diem rates provided by the GSA for each full day you are on approved travel. Partial days will be divided by ⅓ based on the time of actual travel. 

#### 5.4 Registration Fees

- Base conference registration fees are reimbursable. Optional "VIP" or other types of fees are not usually reimbursable.

#### 5.5 Other Expenses

- Booking and change/cancel fees, Parking fees, internet charges (if required for work purposes), documented tips (if locally necessary), travel insurance and necessary business calls are also reimbursable.
