# AlmaLinux Expense and Reimbursement Policy

This policy was adopted by the Board of Directors at [Board meeting #39 in April of 2025](/Transparency.html#minutes-of-almalinux-os-foundation-board-meetings).

### 1. Purpose

This policy establishes the procedure for reimbursing travel, accommodation, and other related expenses incurred by members, contributors, or employees of the AlmaLinux OS Foundation (Foundation) during conferences, events, or activities that align with the Foundation's mission.

### 2. Scope

This policy applies to:

- Foundation staff
- Official contributors and volunteers
- Board members
- Other individuals who are authorized to travel on behalf of the Foundation

### 3. General Principles

- Expenses must be reasonable, necessary, and directly related to the mission of the Foundation
- Prior approval for travel must usually be obtained before incurring any expenses. Expenses at claimant's risk otherwise
- Reimbursement will be based on actual costs and must usually be supported by receipts

### 4. Pre-Travel Approval

While you may apply for reimbursement without pre-approval, there is a significant risk that your claim might be denied or reduced. If you wish to avoid this, please seek pre-approval.

1.  Request Process
    - Submit a Travel Request Form to the Travel Budget Administrator 14 days prior to travel, unless there is a defensible reason for not doing so
    - Include details of the event, purpose, estimated costs, and expected outcomes

### 5. Eligible Expenses

The Foundation will reimburse at least the following expenses:

#### 5.1 Travel

5.1.1 Airfare & Rail & Bus

- Economy class tickets only, apart from cases of genuine need or of benefit to the Foundation agreed with the approver in advance. Upgrades are at the traveler's personal expense. Reasonable luggage and seating charges are permitted.
- Use the most cost-effective and direct route.

  5.1.2 Ground Transportation

- Public transport, ride-shares, or taxis. To the extent a receipt is not available for public transportation, these expenses should be documented by screenshots or affidavits.
- Personal car use (see 5.1.3 below for details).
- Rental cars when more economical than other transport modes. Actual costs must be claimed and not mileage.

  5.1.3 Personal Vehicle Use

- If traveling to a conference or event using a personal car, mileage will be reimbursed at the current IRS mileage rate (or equivalent local government rate for international travelers).
- Mileage reimbursement covers fuel, wear and tear, and insurance costs.

- Total miles driven (round trip).

Additional Car-Related Reimbursable Expenses:

Non-Reimbursable Car Expenses:

#### 5.2 Accommodation

- Reasonable hotel costs (standard rooms only) at or near the event venue.  "Reasonable" usually means at or below the General Services Administration (GSA) or US State Department per diem rates, both plus 30%. When there are no suitable hotels within a reasonable distance of an event venue more expensive options may be approved on a case-by-case basis.

#### 5.3 Meals

- You may claim the per diem rates provided by the GSA for each full day you are on approved travel. Partial days will be divided by ⅓ based on the time on travel.

#### 5.4 Registration Fees
