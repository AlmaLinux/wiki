# AlmaLinux SBOM User Guide 

## About *SBOM*

*SBOM (Software Bill of Materials)* is a list of all open-source and third-party components used in a codebase, along with their licensing information, version numbers, and any known vulnerabilities. 

[AlmaLinux Build System](https://github.com/AlmaLinux/build-system) has implemented *SBOM* into its pipeline for security purposes, such as tracing the build process, ensuring that only trusted sources are used, and reducing the risk of data corruption. 

## About immudb

The AlmaLinux SBOM data is stored in Codenotary's [immudb](https://docs.immudb.io/master/immudb.html#what-is-immudb), which ensures data integrity and provides a chain of trust and traceability. Each stage of the build process goes through authentication and notarization. 

AlmaLinux OS Team has developed [alma-sbom](https://github.com/AlmaLinux/alma-sbom), the SBOM data management utility for AlmaLinux, that generates SBOM records and allows users to track a package to verify if it is notarized and trusted.

## Working with *SBOM* 

### Get the AlmaLinux SBOM tool

To access the SBOM information for AlmaLinux, you need an internet connection to retrieve the records from our AlmaLinux immudb instance.
You also need to install the AlmaLinux SBOM tool:
* Clone the [alma-sbom](https://github.com/AlmaLinux/alma-sbom) repository. 
* Navigate to *alma-sbom* directory.
* Create a Python Virtual Environment:
  ```
  python3.9 -m venv env
  ```
* Activate the Virtual Environment:
  ```
  source env/bin/activate
  ```
* Install dependencies:  
  ```
  pip install .
  ```
  Among installed dependencies there's [immudb-wrapper](https://github.com/AlmaLinux/immudb-wrapper), that is used to interact with our immudb database to save or get SBOM information based on the rpm package hash.
  
### Get the package you want to inspect

To inspect a desired package for *SBOM* information, you need the package information that can be found in [AlmaLinux Build System](https://build.almalinux.org/). You can use the package *build-id* or its *rpm-package-hash*.
* Navigate to [AlmaLinux Build System](https://build.almalinux.org/).
* Find the package you want to inspect in the **Feed** or by using the **Search**.
* Click **Details**. 
  ![image](/images/sbom-details.png)
* Now you can see the **build-id** and the package's **rpm-package-hash**. The cryptographic hash ensures the integrity of this SBOM, meaning it hasn't been tampered with since being stored in immudb. 
You can see and copy the hash by hovering the mouse on the *key* sign and by clicking it.

## Using the AlmaLinux SBOM tool

Run the `python alma_sbom.py` command with the following arguments to get an SBOM record for your package:

* `--output-file` - the file name you want to save the generated SBOM to. The file format can be *JSON* or *XML*. Without providing this argument, generated SBOM results will be shown in the terminal as an output.
* `--file-format` - indicate a desired SBOM format and file format you want to generate. *CycloneDX* and *SPDX* SBOM types are supported. The file format can be *JSON* or *XML*.
* `--build-id` or `--rpm-package-hash` - define one of these arguments, you can find them in the [AlmaLinux Build System](https://build.almalinux.org/).

Here is the command example of generating an SBOM record using the build ID option:

```bash
python alma_sbom.py --output-file 17812.json --file-format cyclonedx-json --build-id 17812
```
The command example with the immudb hash of the package:
```bash
python alma_sbom.py --output-file 17812.json --file-format cyclonedx-json --rpm-package-hash 911945c71710c83cf6f760447c32d8d6cae737dc
```
