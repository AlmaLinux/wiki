# AlmaLinux SBOM User Guide 

&nbsp;

## Introduction

### About *SBOM*

*SBOM (Software Bill of Materials)* is a list of all open-source and third-party components used in a codebase, along with their licensing information, version numbers, and any known vulnerabilities. 

[AlmaLinux Build System](https://github.com/AlmaLinux/build-system) has implemented *SBOM* into its pipeline for security purposes, such as tracing the build process, ensuring that only trusted sources are used, and reducing the risk of data corruption.

### About *CAS*

[*The Codenotary Community Attestation Service (CAS)*](https://cas.codenotary.com) is integrated with AlmaLinux to provide a chain of trust and traceability. Each stage of the build process goes through authentication and notarization, and build artifacts are only stored if they pass authentication via *CAS*. 

A user can use *CAS* to authenticate a downloaded package or its cryptographic hash (SHA256 digest) to verify if it is notarized and trusted.

### Working with *SBOM* 

To access the *CAS* information for AlmaLinux you need an internet connection as the *CAS* records are stored in the AlmaLinux `git` repository. You also need to install the *CAS* tool package. 

Finally, to be able to inspect a desired package for *SBOM* information, you need the package itself (`.rpm` binary). Alternatively, you can use the package `build-id` or `rpm-package-hash` found on the [AlmaLinux build](https://build.almalinux.org/) page.

### Supported releases

 * AlmaLinux 8.7
 * AlmaLinux 9.1

&nbsp;

## Install guide

### Software Prerequisites

To just query the *SBOM* records (versus creating them) one needs only to install the above mentioned `cas` tool. *The CAS* organization provides it in form of source and binary package(s) via their [github](https://github.com/codenotary/cas) and official web service

In the [README.md](https://github.com/codenotary/cas/blob/master/README.md) you can find a cross-platform installation method, presented below.

&nbsp;

### Installation 

#### Official *CAS* installation method (*LinuxÂ®*, *macOS*)

```
bash <(curl https://getcas.codenotary.io -L)
```

For *Windows* check a dedicated section, below.

#### Example on *macOS*

:::tip
The output as shown for *macOS* is identical on [*Linux*](#official-cas-installation-method-linuxÂ®-macos). An alternative install method for *Linux* is described below.

**Warning:** the directory you wish to install to needs to exist before running install command. This is relevant if you're not installing to a system directory like `/usr/local/bin` but to a custom path, like in the example.
:::

##### Install:
```
âžœ  /tmp mkdir ./cas-test
âžœ  /tmp bash <(curl https://getcas.codenotary.io -L)

#### Alternative installation method for AlmaLinux systems

An alternative to *Official CAS installation method* is to install the *CAS* tool package from the AlmaLinux repository. This will (obviously) work exclusively on the AlmaLinux system.

:::tip
The *CAS* package is available in AlmaLinux Architect's COPR (Community Owned Package Repository).  Here, we install it on system based on [AlmaLinux 9.1](https://wiki.almalinux.org/release-notes/9.1.html) release.

**PREP DONE:** At this point your system is ready to work with AlmaLinux *SBOM* infrastructure!

---

&nbsp;

## Using Guide

**Authenticate *SBOM* on packages - definition:**

> **Authentication** - matches the hash of a local asset to a hash on *CAS*. In case of AlmaLinux the local asset is an *RPM* binary package.
 
There are a few ways to authenticate the package:
*  Authenticate by package binary file
*  Authenticate with manually calculated `rpm-package-hash` 
*  Authenticate with `rpm-package-hash` from AlmaLinux Build System


 :::tip
 Note: The `cas` program is a command line tool with a unified interface across all three platforms (*LinuxÂ®, macOS, Windows*); Therefore, the commands shown in the section below can be used on all supported platforms.
 :::

&nbsp;

### Authenticate by package binary file

#### Get the package

To examine a package from the repo you should first get the URL.

:::tip
The package we selected for this demo was: `kernel-5.14.0-162.12.1.el9_1.x86_64.rpm`

URL:
```
http://repo.almalinux.org/almalinux/9.1/BaseOS/x86_64/os/Packages/kernel-5.14.0-162.12.1.el9_1.x86_64.rpm
```
:::

##### Use `curl` to get the package: 
```
curl http://repo.almalinux.org/almalinux/9.1/BaseOS/x86_64/os/Packages/kernel-5.14.0-162.12.1.el9_1.x86_64.rpm -o kernel-5.14.0-162.12.1.el9_1.x86_64.rpm
```

 
#### Authentication using the *CAS* tool
Use the downloaded package file (path) as a parameter for the `cas` command:
```
cas authenticate --signerID=cloud-infra@almalinux.org kernel-5.14.0-162.12.1.el9_1.x86_64.rpm
```
##### Live example

![image](/images/sbom-guide-live-example-auth-by-binary-file.gif)


 **CONGRATULATIONS!** You have just **authenticated** a package with the `cas` CLI tool!
 
&nbsp;
 
### Authenticate with manually calculated `rpm-package-hash` 

You can also calculate package hash manually from CLI. 

Assuming here, you have the package already. If not please refer to "Get the package" above.

To get the `rpm-package-hash` you just need to calculate `sha256sum`:

```
PKG_FILE=kernel-5.14.0-162.12.1.el9_1.x86_64.rpm
SUM=$(sha256sum $PKG_FILE)
HASH=${SUM%%\ *rpm}
```

#### Authentication using the *CAS* tool
Use the calculated hash as value for parameter `--hash` in the `cas` tool invocation:
```
cas authenticate --signerID=cloud-infra@almalinux.org --hash $HASH
```

##### Live example

The whole process as described above should look like:

![image](/images/sbom-guide-live-example-auth-rpm-hash.gif)

  **CONGRATULATIONS!** You have just **authenticated** a package with the `cas` CLI tool!

&nbsp;

### Get `rpm-package-hash` (or package) from AlmaLinux Build System

Alternatively, you can get `rpm-package-has` (and package binary, of course) from the build site.
 
#### 1. Navigate your browser https://build.almalinux.org/
#### 2. Search for a desired package (build) by name, in the example we look for `kernel`:
   
:::tip
To open the search tab click on the magnifying glass icon in the right top corner.
:::
    
:::tip
Naturally, you can narrow the search by supplying more parameters to the filter.
:::

:::tip
More info about working with the build-system page:
    [AlmaLinux Build System User Guide | the build feedscreen](https://https://github.com/AlmaLinux/build-system/wiki/AlmaLinux-Build-System-User-Guide#the-build-feed-screen)
:::
    
#### 3. Click the `â“˜ Details` on the selected entry (here: top one) you will get the build summary: 

![image](/images/sbom-guide-bs-details.png)


#### 4. Select the architecture of the package build by clicking the corresponding tab

#### Here **`x86_64`** was selected:
![image](/images/sbom-guide-bs-select-arch.png)


#### 5. Hover your mouse over the blue key icon to reveal the `rpm-package-hash`:  
   ###### Click to copy it to the clipboard:
![image](/images/sbom-guide-bs-rpm-hash.png)

  :::tip
  You can download the package binary by clicking on the link with its name. 
  :::

&nbsp;

### Authentication using a hash obtained from Build Service

:::tip
The command is the same as above, here just shows output in form of a static picture.
:::

Call the `cas` tool providing the copied `rpm-package-hash` as `--hash` parameter value:
```
cas authenticate --signerID=cloud-infra@almalinux.org --hash ed061fab17b8f269d5fd421a14d0ec81ce5dc357a3ebffe33b5bd2a75e9dd704
```
##### Example output:
```
[almalinux_user@demohost ~]$ cas authenticate --signerID=cloud-infra@almalinux.org --hash ed061fab17b8f269d5fd421a14d0ec81ce5dc357a3ebffe33b5bd2a75e9dd704
