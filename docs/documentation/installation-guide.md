# AlmaLinux installation guide (ISOs)

These guide steps describe how to download AlmaLinux ISO, create a USB stick, and install AlmaLinux OS using it.

## Requirements

* System requirements:
    * Disk space: 10GB minimum, 20GB recommended
    * Minimum 1.5 GB RAM 
    :::tip
    More about requirements: [*Red Hat Enterprise Linux* Technology Capabilities and Limits](https://access.redhat.com/articles/rhel-limits).
    :::
* A USB flash drive of size 8GB as a minimum, 12GB or more recommended

## Download AlmaLinux ISO 

AlmaLinux supports both firmware interfaces: *BIOS* and *UEFI*. 

AlmaLinux supports four architectures:
* Intel/AMD (x86_64)
* ARM64 (aarch64)
* IBM PowerPC (ppc64le)
* IBM Z (s390x)

AlmaLinux has 3 types of ISOs for each supported architecture:
* `boot` - a single network installation CD image that downloads packages over the Internet.
* `minimal` - a minimal self-containing DVD image that makes offline installation possible.
* `dvd`  - a full installation DVD image that contains mostly all AlmaLinux packages. 

:::tip
There are also **latest** and **update** ISO images. **Latest** provides the latest minor version of the selected major version, like AlmaLinux-9-latest. **Update** files are ISOs that were rebuilt including some updates.
:::

There are a few ways to download AlmaLinux ISO:

* Download AlmaLinux ISO from the mirror. Select the nearest to your geographic area mirror from the [list](https://mirrors.almalinux.org/isos.html). You need the **version**/isos/**arch**/ directory to download the suitable ISO.
* Download from the [Public Package Repository](https://repo.almalinux.org/):
    * [AlmaLinux 8](https://repo.almalinux.org/almalinux/8/isos/)
    * [AlmaLinux 9](https://repo.almalinux.org/almalinux/9/isos/)
    * Lower and beta versions can be found in the [Vault](https://repo.almalinux.org/vault/)
* Run the `curl` command in the command line:
  :::warning
  This command example is for downloading the **DVD** ISO of **AlmaLinux 9.1**. AlmaLinux ISOs are named using the following convention:

  **AlmaLinux-major version.minor version-architecture-ISO type.iso**

  Change the version, architecture and type to the ones you need. 
  :::

  ```
  $ curl -O https://repo.almalinux.org/almalinux/9/isos/x86_64/AlmaLinux-9.1-x86_64-dvd.iso
  ```
      
   :::tip
   `curl` is built-in into current versions of *Linux®*, *macOS* and *Windows*.
   :::
    
## ISO verification 

#### Linux
Download and import the AlmaLinux public key:

```bash
$ curl -O https://repo.almalinux.org/almalinux/RPM-GPG-KEY-AlmaLinux-9
$ gpg --import RPM-GPG-KEY-AlmaLinux-9
```

Verify the downloaded ISO image checksum:

```bash
# download a checksums list
$ curl -O https://repo.almalinux.org/almalinux/9/isos/x86_64/CHECKSUM

# verify the checksums list, we are looking for a “Good signature”
$ gpg --verify CHECKSUM
gpg: Signature made Tue 13 Dec 2022 14:09:50 CET
gpg:                using RSA key BF18AC2876178908D6E71267D36CB86CB86B3716

```
    
## Write an image on a USB 

Use the following steps and commands depending on OS you are using to write an image on a USB.

#### Linux

Use the `dd` command for any Linux OS. 

Insert your target USB and locate it. There are different ways to do it, but here are some of them:

* `sudo fdisk -l`  - this command shows you the connected block storage devices, including the USB devices. 

* `lsblk` - this command gives you all the available block storage devices, including the USB block storage devices.

* `sudo blkid` - this command gives you the same information as `lsblk`, but you have to run it as root. 

You need to look for /dev/sda or /dev/sdb or /dev/sdc, which is your target USB.

After you found out the location of your target USB, navigate to the location of your source ISO. Run the dd command to copy files from ISO to USB: 

```
sudo dd if=./AlmaLinux-9.1-x86_64-dvd.iso of=/dev/sdX status=progress conv=fsync bs=4M
```

* `dd`: Start the dd command to write the DVD/CD iso image.
* `if=AlmaLinux-9.1-x86_64-dvd.iso`: path to the input file.
* `of=/dev/sdX`: path to destination USB disk/stick (you need to replace 'X').
* `status=progress`: display a progress bar while writing the image to the USB stick.
* `conv=fsync`: make sure to finish the writing before returning.
* `bs=4M`: use blocks of 4 megabytes instead of the default 512 bytes.

:::warning
This example is for AlmaLinux 9.1. Replace the version with the one you need to work with other AlmaLinux images.
:::

#### Windows

For Windows OS there is a helpful free and open-source application - [Rufus](https://rufus.ie/). 

Open the application, choose your target USB, and ISO you need to burn, and press `start`.

#### macOS

The cross-platform tool [balenaEtcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/) is used to write images on macOS. It is simple too. Open balenaEtcher, choose the image and the USB, and press Flash.
    
You can also use `dd` from the CLI:
    
```
sudo dd if=./AlmaLinux-9.1-x86_64-dvd.iso of=/dev/diskXXX status=progress conv=fsync bs=4M
```
    
:::tip
Look at the Linux example above for detailed command elements description for the `dd` command.
:::

:::tip
To determine the `XXX` (on our machine it was `disk2s1`) open the `Disk Utility` app.
Choose your USB drive in the `External` section and check the disk name in the `Device` field:

:::
    
Now you have AlmaLinux ready on a USB stick.


## Installation

* Before starting the installation, you might need to define which system's mode you are booting and installing - UEFI or BIOS. 
* Insert and boot the USB stick. You'll see the AlmaLinux welcome menu:
 ![image](/images/installation-guide-welcome-menu.png)
    * Automatically, the recommended option *Test this media & install AlmaLinux 9.1* is highlighted. Choosing this option will run the installation media check to verify that it's usable and that the installation won't be aborted in the process. After the media check completes successfully, the installer screen will pop up automatically.
    :::tip
    You can choose the first option *Install AlmaLinux 9.1*. In this case, you will only see some boot messages before the installer will pop up. The installation media check won't be performed.
    :::
* When the installer boots, the first thing you need to do, is to choose a language that will be used during the installation process.
    ![image](/images/installation-guide-installation-language.png)
    Choose the language you'd like and press the **Continue** button.
* Next, the *Installation Summary* window will appear. It contains sections that you can configure:

It depends on your installation source.
    ![image](/images/installation-guide-time-date.gif)
    **When you've finished with the changes, click on the `Done` button.**
* **SOFTWARE** - this section allows you to add the installation source and additional repositories if needed.
    * *Installation Source* - the installation source is to be specified here. When using an ISO image for the installation using, the installation source will be automatically specified as Local media. 
    :::warning
    If you are using the `BOOT` ISO image to perform the installation, you will need to provide the `<version>/BaseOS/x86_64/kickstart/` repository from the selected mirror as the Installation Source if the installer will not be able to find the closest mirror for some reason.

    There are no extra Installation Sources required if you decided to go with either the minimal or DVD ISO images.  
    :::
    **When you've finished with the changes, click on the `Done` button.**
    * *Software Selection* - this section contains two fields:
        * *Base Environment* - this field will be defined automatically according to the ISO type you are using for the installation.
