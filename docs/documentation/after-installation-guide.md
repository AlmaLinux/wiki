# After-installation Guide 

This guide describes recommended actions to be performed after the AlmaLinux OS installation is completed successfully and rebooted. It also contains some steps for the system's customization.

## Update the system and check for security updates

Run the following command in the terminal to check for all available updates including security updates and install them:

```
sudo dnf update
```

### Check for security updates

If you don't want to have all available updates to be installed on your machine, but need to check only for the security updates to ensure that it is up to date and protected against vulnerabilities, run the following command:

```
sudo dnf --security update
``` 

## Configure the network settings

### On a machine with a graphical interface 

If your system has a graphical interface, you can an application. On your panel, open **Settings** via *Applications*:

![image](/images/after-install-settings-1.png)

or find them under *WiFi/Connection* sign:

![image](/images/after-install-settings-2.png)

Using this application you can edit an existing connection or configure a new one. 

### On a machine without a graphical interface 

If your system doesn't have any graphical interface, you can configure network settings using the Network Manager tool - **nmtui**

Run the following command in the terminal:

```
nmtui
```

It will get you to the text user interface tool.

Use the arrow keys to navigate and press *Enter* to select an option of your choice.
 
[Find more](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/7/html/networking_guide/sec-configuring_ip_networking_with_nmtui) about nmtui tool usage.

### Setting the hostname

To set the hostname on AlmaLinux, you can use either the **nmtui** tool or run the `hostnamectl` command in the terminal:

```
hostnamectl set-hostname [new-hostname] # replace new-hostname with the hostmane to set
```

Administrative privileges may be required to use this command.

## Enable necessary repositories

First, list repositories that are already enabled on your AlmaLinux machine:

```
dnf repolist
```

Then, enable a specific repository. Most AlmaLinux repositories can be enabled with the `dnf config-manager --set enabled` command. 
But note, that CentOS SIGs, Extra (EPEL and ELRepo) and AlmaLinux Synergy repositories are enabled with the `dnf install` command.

You can check the [Repositories](/repos/) page to check all the supported repositories and a particular command on how to enable each of them. 

After needed repositories have been enabled, verify the changes: 
```
dnf repolist enabled
```
 
:::tip
It is recommended to update the repository after enabling it:
```
sudo dnf update  
```
Updating the repository will ensure that you have access to the latest software packages and security updates available.

## Install NVIDIA or AMD drivers

Depending on your hardware installed, you might need to install NVIDIA or AMD drivers.

### NVIDIA

You can get NVIDIA drivers in different ways: 
* [Install binary driver](/series/system/SystemSeriesA03)
* [Compile driver source](/series/system/SystemSeriesA03)
* Get them using RPM Fusion:
    * Enable the RPM Fusion repository by running the command: 

      **For AlmaLinux 8:**
      ``` 
      sudo dnf install https://mirrors.rpmfusion.org/free/el/rpmfusion-free-release-8.noarch.rpm https://mirrors.rpmfusion.org/nonfree/el/rpmfusion-nonfree-release-8.noarch.rpm
      ```
      **For AlmaLinux 9:**
      ``` 
      sudo dnf install https://mirrors.rpmfusion.org/free/el/rpmfusion-free-release-9.noarch.rpm https://mirrors.rpmfusion.org/nonfree/el/rpmfusion-nonfree-release-9.noarch.rpm
      ```
    * Next, update the repositories:
      ```
      sudo dnf update  
      ```
    * Install the necessary packages: 
      ```
      sudo dnf install akmod-nvidia
      ```
    * Reboot your system to load the new NVIDIA kernel module and complete the installation. You should now have the NVIDIA drivers successfully installed on your AlmaLinux system.

### AMD

* To install AMD drivers using RPM Fusion on AlmaLinux, first, enable the RPM Fusion repository by running the following commands: 

  **For AlmaLinux 8:**
  ``` 
  sudo dnf install https://mirrors.rpmfusion.org/free/el/rpmfusion-free-release-8.noarch.rpm https://mirrors.rpmfusion.org/nonfree/el/rpmfusion-nonfree-release-8.noarch.rpm
  ```
  **For AlmaLinux 9:**
  ``` 
  sudo dnf install https://mirrors.rpmfusion.org/free/el/rpmfusion-free-release-9.noarch.rpm https://mirrors.rpmfusion.org/nonfree/el/rpmfusion-nonfree-release-9.noarch.rpm
  ```
* Next, update the repositories:
  ```
  sudo dnf update
  ```
* Install the AMD drivers package:
  ```
  sudo dnf install akmod-amdgpu
  ```
* Reboot your system to load the driver.

## Configure firewall settings

To configure firewall settings on AlmaLinux, you can use the built-in firewall management tool - **firewalld**.
* Install the tool:
  ```
  sudo dnf install firewalld
  ```
* Start the firewalld service:
  ```
  sudo systemctl start firewalld
  ```  
* If needed, enable it to start automatically on boot:
  ```
  sudo systemctl enable firewalld
  ```
* Use the `firewall-cmd` command to define rules and zones for your firewall.

[Read more](/series/system/SystemSeriesA02) about the tool's usage.

## Desktop Environment

One of the possible customizations to your AlmaLinux system is having a Desktop Environment of your choice. AlmaLinux supports:
* GNOME
* GNOME-Mini
* KDE
* XFCE
* MATE
* Pantheon for AlmaLinux 9

Some AlmaLinux images already have GNOME and GNOME-Mini desktop environments installed. 

To install GNOME, KDE, and XFCE desktop environments:
* First, enable EPEL and PowerTools/CRB repositories, by running the following commands:

  **For AlmaLinux 8:**
  ```
  sudo dnf config-manager --set-enabled powertools
  sudo dnf install epel-release
  ```
  **For AlmaLinux 9:**
  ``` 
  sudo dnf config-manager --set-enabled crb
  sudo dnf install epel-release
  ```
* List available available package groups:
  ```
  sudo dnf group list
  ``` 
  An example output you may see:
  ``` 
  Available Environment Groups:
    Server with GUI # GNOME Desktop Environment
    Server 
    Workstation # GNOME Desktop Environment
    KDE Plasma Workspaces # KDE Desktop Environment
    Virtualization Host
    Custom Operating System
    ...
  Available Groups:
    ...
    Xfce # XFCE Desktop Environment
  ```
* Install a package group of your choice:
    * GNOME - you can install one of the "Server with GUI" or "Workstation" options to get the GNOME Desktop Environment. Check the list of packages to define which option fits your needs better:
      ```
      dnf group info "Server with GUI" # to list packages of Server with GUI group
      dnf group info "Workstation" # to list packages of Workstation group
      ```
      Install the preferred one:
      ```
      sudo dnf groupinstall "Server with GUI" # install Server with GUI group of packages
      sudo dnf groupinstall "Workstation" # install Workstation group of packages
      ```
    * KDE
      ```
      sudo dnf groupinstall "KDE Plasma Workspaces" 
      ```
    * XFCE
      ```
      sudo dnf groupinstall "Xfce"
      ```

To install Pantheon for AlmaLinux 9:
* Enable EPEL, PowerTools and Synergy repositories
* Install Pantheon Desktop Environment:
  ```
  sudo dnf groupinstall "Pantheon Desktop"
  ```

To have an AlmaLinux system with GNOME-Mini or MATE desktop environments we recommend installing AlmaLinux OS from the corresponding [Live Media image](/LiveMedia).


## Reboot

Reboot your AlmaLinux OS machine to apply all the changes:

```
reboot
```

## Live Media options

If you are not sure whether AlmaLinux fits your needs, you can try it before installing it. AlmaLinux has various Live Media options for this purpose. You can get the download links from the [website](https://almalinux.org/get-almalinux/#Live_Media) and usage guides on the [Live Media](/LiveMedia) page.
