# Google Summer of Code

AlmaLinux is proud to participate in Google's Summer of Code. Please find some details below regarding submitting proposals.

## Application Process

1. Join our [GSoC Chat Channel](https://chat.almalinux.org/almalinux/channels/gsoc). 
2. Introduce yourself and tell us a little bit of your background and interests.
3. Let us know what languages, projects or frameworks you have experience or would like to work in.
4. Have you ever contributed to Open Source before?
5. What would you like to gain out of this experience?

## Ideas

1. Enhancements to the [ELevate](https://almalinux.org/elevate) project. ELevate was introduced as a project to allow in place migrations between major versions of RHEL-derivative distribution. The project has proven wildly popular with thousands of migrations completed successfully. Currently the project support 7.x->8.x. As part of this project you would working under the mentorship of our ELevate team members and release engineering to include support for additional versions such as 8.x->9.x and potentially 6.x->7.x. Also, depending on progress, maybe supporting additional package repositories. **Skill Level: Intermediate** **You should know or will learn RPM, dnf, yum, python, bash**.

2. Work on security update scripts. As part of this project you will work with our release engineering and security teams to help automate the processing of security update-related information, such as having processing scripts based on certain content or keywords (for example by CVE) and scripts to automatically post errata and updates to to mailing lists. **Skill Level: Easy** **You should know or will learn RPM, dnf, yum, python, bash**.

3. Clean up of `countme` scripts and integrate with upstream. AlmaLinux introduced `dnf countme` in December of 2021. As part of this project you will work with our Infrastructure team to help clean up the data and work upstream with the [Fedora Project](https://fedoraproject.org) to have our work integrated upstream. **Skill Level: Easy** **You should know or will learn dnf, yum and python**.

4. Custom Distro Spin tool. We always get requests from users and vendors to include a custom package or some custom software within the distribution for their own use or release. As part of this project you will help create a tool which will allow AlmaLinux users to create a custom respins/isos/LiveCDs. **Skill Level: Advanced-Intermediate** **You should know or will learn RPM, dnf, yum, python, bash**.

5. Propose your own project! We're open to ideas.

## Application
