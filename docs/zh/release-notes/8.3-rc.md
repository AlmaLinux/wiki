# AlmaLinux 8.3 RC release notes

Distributed kernel version: 4.18.0-240.

## Installation instructions

There are three installation ISO images available:

`AlmaLinux-8.3-rc-1-x86_64-boot.iso` - a single network installation CD image
that downloads packages over the Internet.

`AlmaLinux-8.3-rc-1-x86_64-minimal.iso` - a minimal self-containing DVD image
that makes possible offline installation.

`AlmaLinux-8.3-rc-1-x86_64-dvd1.iso` - a full installation DVD image that
contains mostly all AlmaLinux packages.

Select a mirror listed on the
[mirrors.almalinux.org](https://mirrors.almalinux.org/) website (please,
don't use the `repo.almalinux.org` host directly) and download a suitable ISO
image from the `8.3-rc/isos/x86_64/` directory, for example:

```bash
$ wget https://mirror.interserver.net/almalinux/8.3-rc/isos/x86_64/AlmaLinux-8.3-rc-1-x86_64-boot.iso
```

Download and import the AlmaLinux public key:

```bash
$ wget https://repo.almalinux.org/almalinux/RPM-GPG-KEY-AlmaLinux
$ gpg --import RPM-GPG-KEY-AlmaLinux
```

Download and verify a checksums list:

```bash
$ wget https://repo.almalinux.org/almalinux/8.3-rc/isos/x86_64/CHECKSUM

# we are looking for “Good signature” 
$ gpg --verify CHECKSUM 
  gpg: Signature made Fri 19 Feb 2021 03:04:44 PM MSK
  gpg:                using RSA key 51D6647EC21AD6EA
  gpg: Good signature from "AlmaLinux <packager@almalinux.org>" [unknown]
  gpg: WARNING: This key is not certified with a trusted signature!
  gpg:          There is no indication that the signature belongs to the owner.
  Primary key fingerprint: 5E9B 8F56 17B5 066C E920  57C3 488F CF7C 3ABB 34F8
       Subkey fingerprint: E53C F5EF 91CE B0AD 1812  ECB8 51D6 647E C21A D6EA
```

Verify the downloaded ISO image checksum:

```bash
# calculate the downloaded ISO SHA256 checksum
$ sha256sum AlmaLinux-8.3-rc-1-x86_64-boot.iso 
1bf9bff6af3413f8f273e54c11fb45f7da63afea670eafc50dde22c45582be7a  AlmaLinux-8.3-rc-1-x86_64-boot.iso

# compare it with expected checksum, it should be the same
$ cat CHECKSUM | grep -E 'SHA256.*AlmaLinux-8.3-rc-1-x86_64-boot.iso'
SHA256 (AlmaLinux-8.3-rc-1-x86_64-boot.iso) = 1bf9bff6af3413f8f273e54c11fb45f7da63afea670eafc50dde22c45582be7a
```

If you decided to use the `AlmaLinux-8.3-rc-1-x86_64-boot.iso` image, you will
need to provide the `8.3-rc/BaseOS/x86_64/kickstart/` repository from the
selected mirror as the Installation Source.

There are no extra Installation Sources required if you decided to go with
either minimal or dvd ISO images.


## Upgrade instructions

Upgrade the almalinux-release package to the 8.3-3.el8 version from the beta
repositories:

```bash
$ dnf clean all && dnf upgrade -y almalinux-release
```

the new package contains updated repository URLs so that you can just run:

```bash
$ dnf upgrade -y
```

to update the rest of the packages.


## Changelog

* The dnf package manager now uses AlmaLinux public mirrors by default. The
  current list of public mirrors can be found on the
  [mirrors.almalinux.org](https://mirrors.almalinux.org/) website.
* The `HighAvailability` repo is added. It’s disabled by default and can be
  enabled by the `dnf config-manager --set-enabled ha command`
  ([ambz#16](https://bugs.almalinux.org/view.php?id=16)).
* The `subscription-manager` package and its dependencies added
  ([almbz#5](https://bugs.almalinux.org/view.php?id=5)).
* The `satellite-5-client` module moved from the `BaseOS` to the `AppStream`
  repository ([almbz#4](https://bugs.almalinux.org/view.php?id=4)).
* Fixed issues with the `php:7.4` and `nodejs:12` modules installation
  ([almbz#9](https://bugs.almalinux.org/view.php?id=9)).
* Added `maven:3.6` and `jmc:rhel8` modules.
* Completed the `perl:5.30` module build.
* The `/usr/lib/rpm/redhat/dist.sh` utility is now aware of AlmaLinux
  ([almbz#17](https://bugs.almalinux.org/view.php?id=17)).
* Added the `almalinux` RPM macros
  ([almbz#22](https://bugs.almalinux.org/view.php?id=22)).
* The `libreport-almalinux` package is added to support automatic bug
  reporting to [bugs.almalinux.org](https://bugs.almalinux.org/)
  ([almbz#2](https://bugs.almalinux.org/view.php?id=2))
* All installation environments are now available during network install
  ([almbz#14](https://bugs.almalinux.org/view.php?id=14))
* The debuginfo repositories are now populated with packages.


## Known issues

* There is no SecureBoot support in this release
  ([almbz#3](https://bugs.almalinux.org/view.php?id=3)). We are doing our
  best to have it in a stable release.
* The Minimal ISO proposes to install `Server environment with GNOME` but
  actually can only install `Minimal Install` environment
  ([almbz#14](https://bugs.almalinux.org/view.php?id=14)).
* The mirrors support implemented with help of the DNF fastestmirror plugin
  that is known to be a bit "quirky". We are going to switch to
  geo-location-based mirror selection in the stable version.
