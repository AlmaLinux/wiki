## Installation instructions

There are three installation ISO images available:

`AlmaLinux-8.4-beta-1-x86_64-boot.iso` - a single network installation CD image
that downloads packages over the Internet.

`AlmaLinux-8.4-beta-1-x86_64-minimal.iso` - a minimal self-containing DVD image
that makes possible offline installation.

`AlmaLinux-8.4-beta-1-x86_64-dvd.iso` - a full installation DVD image that
contains mostly all AlmaLinux packages.

You can select a mirror closest to your geographic area listed on the [mirrors.almalinux.org](https://mirrors.almalinux.org) website. A local mirrors will be a lot quicker than using ```repo.almalinux.org``` directly. Then, download a suitable ISO image from the 8.4-beta/isos/x86_64/ directory of your source, for example:


```bash
$ wget https://mirror.interserver.net/almalinux/8.4-beta/isos/x86_64/AlmaLinux-8.4-beta-1-x86_64-boot.iso
```

Download and import the AlmaLinux public key:

```bash
$ wget https://repo.almalinux.org/almalinux/RPM-GPG-KEY-AlmaLinux
$ gpg --import RPM-GPG-KEY-AlmaLinux
```

Download and verify a checksums list:

```bash
$ wget https://repo.almalinux.org/almalinux/8.4-beta/isos/x86_64/CHECKSUM

# we are looking for “Good signature”
$ gpg --verify CHECKSUM
  gpg: Signature made Thu Apr 29 11:34:13 2021 UTC
  gpg:                using RSA key 51D6647EC21AD6EA
  gpg: Good signature from "AlmaLinux <packager@almalinux.org>" [unknown]
  gpg: WARNING: This key is not certified with a trusted signature!
  gpg:          There is no indication that the signature belongs to the owner.
  Primary key fingerprint: 5E9B 8F56 17B5 066C E920  57C3 488F CF7C 3ABB 34F8
       Subkey fingerprint: E53C F5EF 91CE B0AD 1812  ECB8 51D6 647E C21A D6EA
```

Verify the downloaded ISO image checksum:

```bash
# calculate the downloaded ISO SHA256 checksum
$ sha256sum AlmaLinux-8.4-beta-1-x86_64-boot.iso
e0e50a5db9cccfa70eaba9b4465e3e727ebed689f1a30dbbd7fcfa6046f05890  AlmaLinux-8.4-beta-1-x86_64-boot.iso

# compare it with expected checksum, it should be the same
$ cat CHECKSUM | grep -E 'SHA256.*AlmaLinux-8.4-beta-1-x86_64-boot.iso'
SHA256 (AlmaLinux-8.4-beta-1-x86_64-boot.iso) = e0e50a5db9cccfa70eaba9b4465e3e727ebed689f1a30dbbd7fcfa6046f05890
```

If you decide to use the `AlmaLinux-8.4-beta-1-x86_64-boot.iso` image, you will
need to provide the `8.4-beta/BaseOS/x86_64/kickstart/` repository from the
selected mirror as the Installation Source.

There are no extra Installation Sources required if you decided to go with
either the minimal or DVD ISO images.


## Upgrade Instructions

**Please do not use these update instructions on production machines, unless you don't mind if something breaks.** ;)

Upgrade the almalinux-release package to the 8.4-1.el8 version from the beta
repositories:

```bash
$ dnf install -y https://repo.almalinux.org/almalinux/almalinux-release-latest-8-beta.x86_64.rpm
$ dnf clean all
```

the new package contains updated repository URLs so that you can just run:

```bash
$ dnf upgrade -y
```

to update the rest of the packages.


## Known issues

* The mirrors support implemented with help of the DNF fastestmirror plugin is known to be a bit "quirky". We are going to switch to geolocation-based mirror selection in the 8.4 stable version.
* The python39-devel:3.9 module is not available in beta and will be added in stable.
