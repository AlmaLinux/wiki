# AlmaLinux 8.3 release notes

Distributed kernel version: 4.18.0-240.

## Installation instructions

There are three installation ISO images available:

`AlmaLinux-8.3-x86_64-boot.iso` - a single network installation CD image
that downloads packages over the Internet.

`AlmaLinux-8.3-x86_64-minimal.iso` - a minimal self-containing DVD image
that makes possible offline installation.

`AlmaLinux-8.3-x86_64-dvd1.iso` - a full installation DVD image that
contains mostly all AlmaLinux packages.

Select a mirror listed on the
[mirrors.almalinux.org](https://mirrors.almalinux.org/) website (please,
don't use the `repo.almalinux.org` host directly) and download a suitable ISO
image from the `8.3/isos/x86_64/` directory, for example:

```bash
$ wget https://mirror.interserver.net/almalinux/8.3/isos/x86_64/AlmaLinux-8.3-x86_64-boot.iso
```

Download and import the AlmaLinux public key:

```bash
$ wget https://repo.almalinux.org/almalinux/RPM-GPG-KEY-AlmaLinux
$ gpg --import RPM-GPG-KEY-AlmaLinux
```

Download and verify a checksums list:

```bash
$ wget https://repo.almalinux.org/almalinux/8.3/isos/x86_64/CHECKSUM

# we are looking for “Good signature”
$ gpg --verify CHECKSUM
  gpg: Signature made Fri 19 Feb 2021 03:04:44 PM MSK
  gpg:                using RSA key 51D6647EC21AD6EA
  gpg: Good signature from "AlmaLinux <packager@almalinux.org>" [unknown]
  gpg: WARNING: This key is not certified with a trusted signature!
  gpg:          There is no indication that the signature belongs to the owner.
  Primary key fingerprint: 5E9B 8F56 17B5 066C E920  57C3 488F CF7C 3ABB 34F8
       Subkey fingerprint: E53C F5EF 91CE B0AD 1812  ECB8 51D6 647E C21A D6EA
```

Verify the downloaded ISO image checksum:

```bash
# calculate the downloaded ISO SHA256 checksum
$ sha256sum AlmaLinux-8.3-x86_64-boot.iso
08fd99fab31277ea3710bfc1ccb8a7229522af5d3987d5b062739cb0dc3b5e3e  AlmaLinux-8.3-x86_64-boot.iso

# compare it with expected checksum, it should be the same
$ cat CHECKSUM | grep -E 'SHA256.*AlmaLinux-8.3-x86_64-boot.iso'
SHA256 (AlmaLinux-8.3-x86_64-boot.iso) = 08fd99fab31277ea3710bfc1ccb8a7229522af5d3987d5b062739cb0dc3b5e3e
```

If you decided to use the `AlmaLinux-8.3-x86_64-boot.iso` image, you will
need to provide the `8.3/BaseOS/x86_64/kickstart/` repository from the
selected mirror as the Installation Source.

There are no extra Installation Sources required if you decided to go with
either minimal or dvd ISO images.


## Upgrade instructions

Upgrade the almalinux-release package to the 8.3-3.el8 version from the beta
or rc repositories:

```bash
$ dnf clean all && dnf upgrade -y almalinux-release
```

the new package contains updated repository URLs so that you can just run:

```bash
$ dnf upgrade -y
```

to update the rest of the packages.


## Changelog

* The Minimal ISO now proposes to install only environments that can be
  installed from it ([almbz#14](https://bugs.almalinux.org/view.php?id=14)).


## Known issues

* There is no SecureBoot support in this release
  ([almbz#3](https://bugs.almalinux.org/view.php?id=3)). We are doing our
  best to have it in a stable release.
* The mirrors support implemented with help of the DNF fastestmirror plugin
  that is known to be a bit "quirky". We are going to switch to
  geo-location-based mirror selection in the stable version.
