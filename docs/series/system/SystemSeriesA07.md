In some case Wayland may interfere with software installed and require Xorg instead. This is the way to rollback to Xorg.

# Open the terminal on the host machine.

# Gain administrative privileges by using the sudo command:
```Bash
sudo su
```

# Navigate to the /etc/gdm/ directory:
```Bash
cd /etc/gdm/
```

# Open the custom.conf file in a text editor of your choice. For example, you can use the nano editor:
```Bash
Ensure that these lines are within the block that starts with # {mark} ANSIBLE MANAGED BLOCK.
sudo nano custom.conf
```

# Find or add the following lines to the file:
```Bash
WaylandEnable=false
DefaultSession=gnome-xorg.desktop
```

# Save the changes and exit the text editor. If you are using nano, you can press Ctrl + X, then press Y to confirm changes, and finally press Enter to exit.

# Restart the system or the display manager for the changes to take effect.
