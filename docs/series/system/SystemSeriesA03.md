## 🌟 Introduction

This guide provides instructions how to install NVIDIA's graphics driver for AlmaLinux in to variants:

- **Binary Driver** [**8.x**](#) | [**9.x**]() 👈 <small>USING PRECOMPILED DRIVERS IS RECOMMENDED</small>
- **Compiling From Source** [**8.x**]() | [**9.x**]() ⚠️  <small>REQURIES SWITCHING TO ELRepo KERNEL</small>

## 🧠 Fundamental Concepts

### Dynamic Kernel Module Support (DKMS)

DKMS is a system utility that allows you to automatically build kernel modules.

### ELRepo Kernel

ELRepo is a community repository for Enterprise Linux distributions (e.g., RHEL, CentOS, AlmaLinux). It focuses on hardware-related packages to enhance your Linux experience. This is repo provides a kernel (packages) which tracks mainline kernel very closely. In result, this kernel is updated frequently and sometimes it leads to temporary incompatiblity with NVIDIA driver sources.

### NVIDIA Drivers Source
Install the NVIDIA graphics driver using the DKMS (Dynamic Kernel Module Support). Needs switching the kernel to ELRepo kernel version.

### NVIDIA Precompiled/Binary Drivers
NVIDIA compiles and tests this driver each precise kernel version. Installing it locks your kernel upgrade with (driver). It is the recommended way according to NVIDIA.
