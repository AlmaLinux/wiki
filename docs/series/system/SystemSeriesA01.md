## üåü Introduction

This guide will introduce the fundamental concepts of AppStream modules and demonstrate their usage in an AlmaLinux environment. With the introduction of Application Streams in Red Hat¬Æ Enterprise Linux 8, user-space components can be delivered and updated more frequently than the core operating system packages. This feature enables greater customization of your AlmaLinux installation without compromising the platform's underlying stability or specific deployments.

## üß† Fundamental Concepts

### AppStream

The AppStream repository contains both modular and non-modular packages. Non-modular packages, which serve as general-purpose utilities, libraries, or dependencies, are not tied to any specific module. They can be installed and updated independently, offering users more flexibility and control over their software stack.

### AppStream Modularity

AppStream's modular design ensures the delivery of software packages as independent modules, each with its own release schedule and lifecycle. This approach facilitates the provision of new features and updates for applications without necessitating a complete operating system upgrade. By incorporating both modular and non-modular packages, AppStream provides users with a wide variety of software options while maintaining system stability, compatibility, and security.
AppStream modules provide a cohesive and tested set of packages that work together and ensure that all necessary packages are installed and configured correctly.

## üìù Key Takeaways

To use AppStream modules in your AlmaLinux environment, you need to understand the following fundamental concepts:

- **Modules**: A module is a set of RPM packages that represent a component and are usually installed together. A typical module includes packages with the application, application-specific dependency libraries, documentation, and helper utilities.
- **Streams**: A stream is a version of a module. A module can have multiple streams that represent different versions of the same component.
- **Profiles**: A profile is a set of streams for a module. Each profile represents a specific use case or workload.

## üìñ Version Specific Examples

### ‚û°Ô∏è Version independent calling (here installing) syntax is:

`sudo dnf module install nginx:<stream>/<profile>`

::: tip
There is a substantially greater number of AppStream modules available for the AlmaLinux 8.x series compared to the 9.x series.

:::warning
Below we show list of modules available for each (major) AlmaLinux release.
