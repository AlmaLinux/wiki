## Installation instructions

There are three installation ISO images available:

`AlmaLinux-8.9-x86_64-boot.iso` - a single network installation CD image that downloads packages over the Internet.

`AlmaLinux-8.9-x86_64-minimal.iso` - a minimal self-containing DVD image that makes possible offline installation.

`AlmaLinux-8.9-x86_64-dvd.iso` - a full installation DVD image that contains mostly all AlmaLinux packages.

You can select a mirror closest to your geographic area listed on the [mirrors.almalinux.org](https://mirrors.almalinux.org) website. A local mirror will be a lot quicker than using ```repo.almalinux.org``` directly. Then, download a suitable ISO image from the 8.9/isos/$arch/ directory of your source, for example:


```bash
$ wget https://mirror.interserver.net/almalinux/8.9/isos/x86_64/AlmaLinux-8.9-x86_64-boot.iso
```

Download and import the AlmaLinux public key:

```bash
$ wget https://repo.almalinux.org/almalinux/RPM-GPG-KEY-AlmaLinux
$ gpg --import RPM-GPG-KEY-AlmaLinux
```

Download and verify a checksums list:

```bash
$ wget https://repo.almalinux.org/almalinux/8.9/isos/x86_64/CHECKSUM

# we are looking for “Good signature”
$ gpg --verify CHECKSUM
gpg: Signature made Mon 20 Nov 2023 02:10:58 PM EST
gpg:                using RSA key E53CF5EF91CEB0AD1812ECB851D6647EC21AD6EA
gpg: Good signature from "AlmaLinux <packager@almalinux.org>" [unknown]
gpg: WARNING: This key is not certified with a trusted signature!
gpg:          There is no indication that the signature belongs to the owner.
Primary key fingerprint: 5E9B 8F56 17B5 066C E920  57C3 488F CF7C 3ABB 34F8
     Subkey fingerprint: E53C F5EF 91CE B0AD 1812  ECB8 51D6 647E C21A D6EA
```

Verify the downloaded ISO image checksum:

```bash
# calculate the downloaded ISO SHA256 checksum
$ sha256sum AlmaLinux-8.9-x86_64-boot.iso
ab861d80c8b68634f3c16d414a4141759a082548ad7b251d8924675fa09decab  AlmaLinux-8.9-x86_64-boot.iso

# compare it with expected checksum, it should be the same
$ cat CHECKSUM | grep -E 'SHA256.*AlmaLinux-8.9-x86_64-boot.iso'
SHA256 (AlmaLinux-8.9-x86_64-boot.iso) = ab861d80c8b68634f3c16d414a4141759a082548ad7b251d8924675fa09decab
```

If you decide to use the `AlmaLinux-8.9-x86_64-boot.iso` image, you will need to provide the `8.9/BaseOS/x86_64/kickstart/` URL repository from the selected mirror as the Installation Source if the installer will not be able to find closest mirror for some reason.

There are no extra Installation Sources required if you decided to go with either the minimal or DVD ISO images.
