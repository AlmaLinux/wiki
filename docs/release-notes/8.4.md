## Installation instructions

There are three installation ISO images available:

`AlmaLinux-8.4-x86_64-boot.iso` - a single network installation CD image
that downloads packages over the Internet.

`AlmaLinux-8.4-x86_64-minimal.iso` - a minimal self-containing DVD image
that makes possible offline installation.

`AlmaLinux-8.4-x86_64-dvd.iso` - a full installation DVD image that
contains mostly all AlmaLinux packages.

The recommended way to download ISO images is using the [torrent](https://repo.almalinux.org/almalinux/8.4/isos/x86_64/AlmaLinux-8.4.torrent) links. Alternatively, you can select a mirror closest to your geographic area listed on the [mirrors.almalinux.org](https://mirrors.almalinux.org) website (local mirrors will be a lot quicker than using ```repo.almalinux.org``` directly) and download a suitable ISO image from the 8.4/isos/x86_64/ directory, for example:


```bash
$ wget https://mirror.interserver.net/almalinux/8.4/isos/x86_64/AlmaLinux-8.4-x86_64-boot.iso
```

Download and import the AlmaLinux public key:

```bash
$ wget https://repo.almalinux.org/almalinux/RPM-GPG-KEY-AlmaLinux
$ gpg --import RPM-GPG-KEY-AlmaLinux
```

Download and verify a checksums list:

```bash
$ wget https://repo.almalinux.org/almalinux/8.4/isos/x86_64/CHECKSUM

# we are looking for “Good signature”
$ gpg --verify CHECKSUM
gpg: Signature made Wed 26 May 2021 08:21:40 AM UTC using RSA key ID C21AD6EA
gpg: Good signature from "AlmaLinux <packager@almalinux.org>"
gpg: WARNING: This key is not certified with a trusted signature!
gpg:          There is no indication that the signature belongs to the owner.
Primary key fingerprint: 5E9B 8F56 17B5 066C E920  57C3 488F CF7C 3ABB 34F8
     Subkey fingerprint: E53C F5EF 91CE B0AD 1812  ECB8 51D6 647E C21A D6EA
```

Verify the downloaded ISO image checksum:

```bash
# calculate the downloaded ISO SHA256 checksum
$ sha256sum AlmaLinux-8.4-x86_64-boot.iso
76e8f56892e6d90706b142868eec51b6b8c015ec3792f8d9e0730da93a2d1162  AlmaLinux-8.4-x86_64-boot.iso

# compare it with expected checksum, it should be the same
$ cat CHECKSUM | grep -E 'SHA256.*AlmaLinux-8.4-x86_64-boot.iso'
SHA256 (AlmaLinux-8.4-x86_64-boot.iso) = 76e8f56892e6d90706b142868eec51b6b8c015ec3792f8d9e0730da93a2d1162
```

If you've decided to use the `AlmaLinux-8.4-x86_64-boot.iso` image, you will
need to provide the `8.4/BaseOS/x86_64/kickstart/` repository from the
selected mirror as the Installation Source.

There are no extra Installation Sources required if you decided to go with
either the minimal or DVD ISO images.


## Upgrade Instructions

Just run:
```bash
$ dnf upgrade -y
```
to update your AlmaLinux OS 8.3 stable to 8.4.  
If you’re upgrading from 8.4 beta then you should run
```bash
$ dnf upgrade -y
```
twice.


## Known issues

* The mirrors support implemented with help of the DNF fastestmirror plugin is known to be a bit "quirky". We are going to switch to geo-location-based mirror selection soon.
* We don’t provide OVAL definitions for AlmaLinux updates yet so the `Ensure Software Patches Installed` OpenSCAP check will be marked as `notchecked`. However, OpenSCAP is already configured for AlmaLinux OVAL sources so no configuration will be needed when definitions become available.
