You can reference the upstream [RHEL 9.0 beta release notes](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/9-beta/html/9.0_release_notes/overview#overview-major-changes) for a full list of changes in this release.


## Installation instructions

There are three installation ISO images available:

`AlmaLinux-9.0-beta-1-x86_64-boot.iso` - a single network installation CD image that downloads packages over the Internet.

`AlmaLinux-9.0-beta-1-x86_64-minimal.iso` - a minimal self-containing DVD image that makes possible offline installation.

`AlmaLinux-9.0-beta-1-x86_64-dvd.iso` - a full installation DVD image that contains mostly all AlmaLinux packages.

You can select a mirror closest to your geographic area listed on the [mirrors.almalinux.org](https://mirrors.almalinux.org) website. A local mirror will be a lot quicker than using ```repo.almalinux.org``` directly. Then, download a suitable ISO image from the 9-beta/isos/$arch/ directory of your source, for example:


```bash
$ wget https://mirror.interserver.net/almalinux/9.0-beta/isos/x86_64/AlmaLinux-9.0-beta-1-x86_64-boot.iso
```

Download and import the AlmaLinux public key:

```bash
$ wget https://repo.almalinux.org/almalinux/RPM-GPG-KEY-AlmaLinux-9
$ gpg --import RPM-GPG-KEY-AlmaLinux-9
```

Download and verify a checksums list:

```bash
$ wget https://repo.almalinux.org/almalinux/9.0-beta/isos/x86_64/CHECKSUM

# we are looking for “Good signature”
$ gpg --verify CHECKSUM
gpg: Signature made Mon 18 Apr 2022 09:59:43 PM UTC using RSA key ID B86B3716
gpg: Good signature from "AlmaLinux OS 9 <packager@almalinux.org>"
gpg: WARNING: This key is not certified with a trusted signature!
gpg:          There is no indication that the signature belongs to the owner.
Primary key fingerprint: BF18 AC28 7617 8908 D6E7  1267 D36C B86C B86B 3716
```

Verify the downloaded ISO image checksum:

```bash
# calculate the downloaded ISO SHA256 checksum
$ sha256sum AlmaLinux-9.0-beta-1-x86_64-boot.iso
62faf2d2f3449f247435cd91ec6155ed9d1c1f949f55c17b75827cb0f98adef2  AlmaLinux-9.0-beta-1-x86_64-boot.iso

# compare it with expected checksum, it should be the same
$ cat CHECKSUM | grep -E 'SHA256.*AlmaLinux-9.0-beta-1-x86_64-boot.iso'
SHA256 (AlmaLinux-9.0-beta-1-x86_64-boot.iso) = 62faf2d2f3449f247435cd91ec6155ed9d1c1f949f55c17b75827cb0f98adef2
```

If you decide to use the `AlmaLinux-9.0-beta-1-x86_64-boot.iso` image, you will need to provide the `9.0-beta/BaseOS/x86_64/kickstart/` repository from the selected mirror as the Installation Source if the installer will not be able to find closest mirror for some reason.

There are no extra Installation Sources required if you decided to go with either the minimal or DVD ISO images.


## Known issues

* OpenSCAP AlmaLinux 9 profiles are not ready yet and will be released later
