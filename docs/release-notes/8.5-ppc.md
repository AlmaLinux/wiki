## Providing Feedback and Getting Help

Please report any issues you may encounter on the [AlmaLinux Bug Tracker](https://bugs.almalinux.org/). Additionally, if you feel like providing feedback, talking about anything or asking any questions you might want to check out [The AlmaLinux Community Chat](https://chat.almalinux.org), [The AlmaLinux Forums](https://forums.almalinux.org/c/85/5) and [The AlmaLinux Community on Reddit](https://reddit.com/r/almalinux).

## Changelog

This changelog contains updates that have been improved or added since PowerPC 8.5 Beta release. You can reference the upstream [RHEL 8.5 release notes](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/8/html/8.5_release_notes/index) for a full list of changes in the 8.5 Stable release.

- Added the **maven:3.6** module.

## Installation instructions

There are three installation ISO images available:

`AlmaLinux-8.5-ppc64le-boot.iso` - a single network installation CD image that downloads packages over the Internet.

`AlmaLinux-8.5-ppc64le-minimal.iso` - a minimal self-containing DVD image that makes possible offline installation.

`AlmaLinux-8.5-ppc64le-dvd.iso` - a full installation DVD image that contains mostly all AlmaLinux packages.

You should select a mirror closest to your geographic area listed on the [mirrors.almalinux.org](https://mirrors.almalinux.org) website (local mirrors will be a lot quicker than using `repo.almalinux.org` directly) and download a suitable ISO image from the 8.5/isos/ppc64le/ directory, for example:

```bash
$ wget https://repo.almalinux.org/almalinux/8.5/isos/ppc64le/AlmaLinux-8.5-ppc64le-boot.iso
```

Download and import the AlmaLinux public key:

```bash
$ wget https://repo.almalinux.org/almalinux/RPM-GPG-KEY-AlmaLinux
$ gpg --import RPM-GPG-KEY-AlmaLinux
```

Download and verify a checksums list:

```bash
$ wget https://repo.almalinux.org/almalinux/8.5/isos/ppc64le/CHECKSUM

# we are looking for “Good signature”
$ gpg --verify CHECKSUM
gpg: Signature made Thu 24 Feb 2022 07:16:49 PM UTC using RSA key ID C21AD6EA
gpg: Good signature from "AlmaLinux <packager@almalinux.org>"
gpg: WARNING: This key is not certified with a trusted signature!
gpg:          There is no indication that the signature belongs to the owner.
Primary key fingerprint: 5E9B 8F56 17B5 066C E920  57C3 488F CF7C 3ABB 34F8
     Subkey fingerprint: E53C F5EF 91CE B0AD 1812  ECB8 51D6 647E C21A D6EA
```

Verify the downloaded ISO image checksum:

```bash
# calculate the downloaded ISO SHA256 checksum
$ sha256sum AlmaLinux-8.5-ppc64le-boot.iso
edc1d2713f97db5104271de6a35d4e8f3cc0464ba0467ebc080ab7dd68f92de1  AlmaLinux-8.5-ppc64le-boot.iso

# compare it with expected checksum, it should be the same
$ cat CHECKSUM | grep -E 'SHA256.*AlmaLinux-8.5-ppc64le-boot.iso'
SHA256 (AlmaLinux-8.5-ppc64le-boot.iso) = edc1d2713f97db5104271de6a35d4e8f3cc0464ba0467ebc080ab7dd68f92de1
```

If you decide to use the `AlmaLinux-8.5-ppc64le-boot.iso` image, you will
need to provide the `8.5/BaseOS/ppc64le/kickstart/` repository from the
selected mirror as the Installation Source.

There are no extra Installation Sources required if you decided to go with
either the minimal or DVD ISO images.
