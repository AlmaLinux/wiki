## Installation instructions

There are three installation ISO images available:

`AlmaLinux-8.4-aarch64-boot.iso` - a single network installation CD image
that downloads packages over the Internet.

`AlmaLinux-8.4-aarch64-minimal.iso` - a minimal self-containing DVD image
that makes possible offline installation.

`AlmaLinux-8.4-aarch64-dvd.iso` - a full installation DVD image that
contains mostly all AlmaLinux packages.

You should select a mirror closest to your geographic area listed on the [mirrors.almalinux.org](https://mirrors.almalinux.org) website (local mirrors will be a lot quicker than using ```repo.almalinux.org``` directly) and download a suitable ISO image from the 8.4/isos/aarch64/ directory, for example:


```bash
$ wget http://almalinux-mirror.tpa.hivelocity.net/8.4/isos/aarch64/AlmaLinux-8.4-aarch64-boot.iso
```

Download and import the AlmaLinux public key:

```bash
$ wget https://repo.almalinux.org/almalinux/RPM-GPG-KEY-AlmaLinux
$ gpg --import RPM-GPG-KEY-AlmaLinux
```

Download and verify a checksums list:

```bash
$ wget https://repo.almalinux.org/almalinux/8.4/isos/aarch64/CHECKSUM

# we are looking for “Good signature”
$ gpg --verify CHECKSUM
gpg: Signature made Fri 25 Jun 2021 09:01:15 AM UTC using RSA key ID C21AD6EA
gpg: Good signature from "AlmaLinux <packager@almalinux.org>"
gpg: WARNING: This key is not certified with a trusted signature!
gpg:          There is no indication that the signature belongs to the owner.
Primary key fingerprint: 5E9B 8F56 17B5 066C E920  57C3 488F CF7C 3ABB 34F8
     Subkey fingerprint: E53C F5EF 91CE B0AD 1812  ECB8 51D6 647E C21A D6EA
```

Verify the downloaded ISO image checksum:

```bash
# calculate the downloaded ISO SHA256 checksum
$ sha256sum AlmaLinux-8.4-aarch64-boot.iso
80bf7881a4c9df4d2ec6a8167a848aaa48a589e642cda4e020231b8577813d0e  AlmaLinux-8.4-aarch64-boot.iso

# compare it with expected checksum, it should be the same
$ cat CHECKSUM | grep -E 'SHA256.*AlmaLinux-8.4-aarch64-boot.iso'
SHA256 (AlmaLinux-8.4-aarch64-boot.iso) = 80bf7881a4c9df4d2ec6a8167a848aaa48a589e642cda4e020231b8577813d0e
```

If you decide to use the `AlmaLinux-8.4-aarch64-boot.iso` image, you may
need to provide the `8.4/BaseOS/aarch64/kickstart/` repository from the
selected mirror as the Installation Source if the installer will not be able
to find closest mirror for some reason.

There are no extra Installation Sources required if you decided to go with
either the minimal or DVD ISO images.


## Known issues

* The mirrors support implemented with help of the DNF fastestmirror plugin is known to be a bit "quirky". We are going to switch to geolocation-based mirror selection soon.
* We don’t provide OVAL definitions for AlmaLinux updates yet so the `Ensure Software Patches Installed` OpenSCAP check will be marked as `notchecked`. However, OpenSCAP is already configured for AlmaLinux OVAL sources so no configuration will be needed when definitions become available.
