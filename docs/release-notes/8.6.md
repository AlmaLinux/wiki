## Installation instructions

There are three installation ISO images available:

`AlmaLinux-8.6-x86_64-boot.iso` - a single network installation CD image that downloads packages over the Internet.

`AlmaLinux-8.6-x86_64-minimal.iso` - a minimal self-containing DVD image that makes possible offline installation.

`AlmaLinux-8.6-x86_64-dvd.iso` - a full installation DVD image that contains mostly all AlmaLinux packages.

The recommended way to download ISO images is using the [torrent](https://repo.almalinux.org/almalinux/8.6/isos/x86_64/AlmaLinux-8.6-x86_64.torrent) links. Alternatively, you can select a mirror closest to your geographic area listed on the [mirrors.almalinux.org](https://mirrors.almalinux.org) website. A local mirror will be a lot quicker than using `repo.almalinux.org` directly. Then, download a suitable ISO image from the 8.6/isos/$arch/ directory of your source, for example:

```bash
$ wget https://mirror.interserver.net/almalinux/8.6/isos/x86_64/AlmaLinux-8.6-x86_64-boot.iso
```

Download and import the AlmaLinux public key:

```bash
$ wget https://repo.almalinux.org/almalinux/RPM-GPG-KEY-AlmaLinux
$ gpg --import RPM-GPG-KEY-AlmaLinux
```

Download and verify a checksums list:

```bash
$ wget https://repo.almalinux.org/almalinux/8.6/isos/x86_64/CHECKSUM

# we are looking for “Good signature”
$ gpg --verify CHECKSUM
gpg: Signature made Wed May 11 21:11:12 2022 UTC
gpg:                using RSA key 51D6647EC21AD6EA
gpg: Good signature from "AlmaLinux <packager@almalinux.org>" [unknown]
gpg: WARNING: This key is not certified with a trusted signature!
gpg:          There is no indication that the signature belongs to the owner.
Primary key fingerprint: 5E9B 8F56 17B5 066C E920  57C3 488F CF7C 3ABB 34F8
     Subkey fingerprint: E53C F5EF 91CE B0AD 1812  ECB8 51D6 647E C21A D6EA
```

Verify the downloaded ISO image checksum:

```bash
# calculate the downloaded ISO SHA256 checksum
$ sha256sum AlmaLinux-8.6-x86_64-boot.iso
de92004fcc5bb5b9af586c9b5ab0e0c7c5a5eedce4d2be85156c5dd31a4fa81b  AlmaLinux-8.6-x86_64-boot.iso

# compare it with expected checksum, it should be the same
$ cat CHECKSUM | grep -E 'SHA256.*AlmaLinux-8.6-x86_64-boot.iso'
SHA256 (AlmaLinux-8.6-x86_64-boot.iso) = de92004fcc5bb5b9af586c9b5ab0e0c7c5a5eedce4d2be85156c5dd31a4fa81b
```

If you decide to use the `AlmaLinux-8.6-x86_64-boot.iso` image, you will need to provide the `8.6/BaseOS/x86_64/kickstart/` repository from the selected mirror as the Installation Source if the installer will not be able to find closest mirror for some reason.

There are no extra Installation Sources required if you decided to go with either the minimal or DVD ISO images.

Notice: the size of the ramdisk has increased. If you encounter remote "ks.cfg not found" this could be due memory limits in your template VM (4GB of RAM is known to work)

## Upgrade Instructions from 8.5 to 8.6

To update your AlmaLinux OS 8.5 Stable to 8.6:
