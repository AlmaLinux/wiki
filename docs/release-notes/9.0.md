## Upstream Release Notes

## Changelog

- AlmaLinux 9 packages and repositories are signed with the new [RPM-GPG-KEY-AlmaLinux-9](http://repo.almalinux.org/almalinux/RPM-GPG-KEY-AlmaLinux-9) GPG key

- The use of SHA-1 for signatures is restricted in the default crypto policy. Please be aware that this may cause issues using **SSH** to access older systems, such as RHEL/CentOS 6. To allow SHA-1 you can run:

```
update-crypto-policies --set DEFAULT:SHA1
```

## Installation Instructions

There are three installation ISO images available:

`AlmaLinux-9.0-x86_64-boot.iso` - a single network installation CD image that downloads packages over the Internet.

`AlmaLinux-9.0-x86_64-minimal.iso` - a minimal self-containing DVD image for local/offline installation.

`AlmaLinux-9.0-x86_64-dvd.iso` - a full installation DVD image that contains almost all AlmaLinux packages.

The recommended way to download ISO images is using the [torrent](https://repo.almalinux.org/almalinux/9.0/isos/x86_64/AlmaLinux-9.0-x86_64.torrent) links. Alternatively, you can select a mirror closest to your geographic area listed on the [mirrors.almalinux.org](https://mirrors.almalinux.org) website. A local mirror will be a lot quicker than using `repo.almalinux.org` directly. Then, download a suitable ISO image from the 9/isos/$arch/ directory of your source, for example:

```bash
$ wget https://mirror.interserver.net/almalinux/9.0/isos/x86_64/AlmaLinux-9.0-x86_64-boot.iso
```

Download and import the AlmaLinux public key:

```bash
$ wget https://repo.almalinux.org/almalinux/RPM-GPG-KEY-AlmaLinux-9
$ gpg --import RPM-GPG-KEY-AlmaLinux-9
```

Download and verify a checksums list:

```bash
$ wget https://repo.almalinux.org/almalinux/9.0/isos/x86_64/CHECKSUM

# we are looking for “Good signature”
$ gpg --verify CHECKSUM
gpg: Signature made Wed 25 May 2022 11:08:37 PM UTC
gpg:                using RSA key D36CB86CB86B3716
gpg: Good signature from "AlmaLinux OS 9 <packager@almalinux.org>" [unknown]
gpg: WARNING: This key is not certified with a trusted signature!
gpg:          There is no indication that the signature belongs to the owner.
Primary key fingerprint: BF18 AC28 7617 8908 D6E7  1267 D36C B86C B86B 3716
```

Verify the downloaded ISO image checksum:

```bash
# calculate the downloaded ISO SHA256 checksum
$ sha256sum AlmaLinux-9.0-x86_64-boot.iso
c41ce7bc2f4ab27a3597b3e160fc8b01c56a6b58e1046a4a23b8518fb9e9a61f  AlmaLinux-9.0-x86_64-boot.iso

# compare it with expected checksum, it should be the same
$ cat CHECKSUM | grep -E 'SHA256.*AlmaLinux-9.0-x86_64-boot.iso'
SHA256 (AlmaLinux-9.0-1-x86_64-boot.iso) = c41ce7bc2f4ab27a3597b3e160fc8b01c56a6b58e1046a4a23b8518fb9e9a61f
```

If you decide to use the `AlmaLinux-9.0-x86_64-boot.iso` image, you will need to provide the `9.0/BaseOS/x86_64/kickstart/` repository from the selected mirror as the Installation Source if the installer will not be able to find closest mirror for some reason.

There are no extra Installation Sources required if you decided to go with either the minimal or DVD ISO images.
