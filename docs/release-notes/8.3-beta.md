The release code name: Purple [Manul](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pallas%27s_cat).

CloudLinux is proud to present the beta version of AlmaLinux. After roughly a month and a half from the announcement, here is a 1:1 RHEL binary compatible replacement for your RHEL-based systems. 

This is for the community and by the community, you're the soul of Linux. Thank you for your interest and suggestions so far, keep them coming.

## Installation instructions

There are three installation ISO images available:

`AlmaLinux-8.3-beta-1-x86_64-boot.iso` - a single network installation CD image that downloads packages over the Internet.

`AlmaLinux-8.3-beta-1-x86_64-minimal.iso` - a minimal self-containing DVD image that makes possible offline installation.

`AlmaLinux-8.3-beta-1-x86_64-dvd1.iso` - a full installation DVD image that contains mostly all AlmaLinux packages. We don't really recommend using it unless you need to set up and use AlmaLinux on a machine without internet access.

Download a preferable ISO image and verify its checksum. Here is an example for GNU/Linux:

 ```bash
# download and import the AlmaLinux public key
$ wget https://repo.almalinux.org/almalinux/RPM-GPG-KEY-AlmaLinux
$ gpg --import RPM-GPG-KEY-AlmaLinux

# download a checksums list
$ wget https://repo.almalinux.org/almalinux/8.3-beta/isos/x86_64/CHECKSUM

# verify the checksums list, we are looking for “Good signature”
$ gpg --verify CHECKSUM 
gpg: Signature made Thu 28 Jan 2021 11:39:12 PM MSK
gpg:                using RSA key 51D6647EC21AD6EA
gpg: Good signature from "AlmaLinux <packager@almalinux.org>" [unknown]
gpg: WARNING: This key is not certified with a trusted signature!
gpg:          There is no indication that the signature belongs to the owner.
Primary key fingerprint: 5E9B 8F56 17B5 066C E920  57C3 488F CF7C 3ABB 34F8
     Subkey fingerprint: E53C F5EF 91CE B0AD 1812  ECB8 51D6 647E C21A D6EA

# download the network install ISO
$ wget https://repo.almalinux.org/almalinux/8.3-beta/isos/x86_64/AlmaLinux-8.3-beta-1-x86_64-boot.iso

# calculate the downloaded ISO SHA256 checksum
$ sha256sum AlmaLinux-8.3-beta-1-x86_64-boot.iso 
d15be406f417e81382b46a54d87dff01c8ca770c847c18703f19146587b61a1f  AlmaLinux-8.3-beta-1-x86_64-boot.iso

# compare it with expected checksum, it should be the same
$ cat CHECKSUM | grep -E 'SHA256.*AlmaLinux-8.3-beta-1-x86_64-boot.iso'
SHA256 (AlmaLinux-8.3-beta-1-x86_64-boot.iso) = d15be406f417e81382b46a54d87dff01c8ca770c847c18703f19146587b61a1f
 ```

If you decided to use the `AlmaLinux-8.3-beta-1-x86_64-boot.iso` image, you
will need to provide this `https://repo.almalinux.org/almalinux/8.3-beta/BaseOS/x86_64/kickstart/`
repository as the Installation Source:

![installation source](./almalinux-install-source.png)

If you are going to install a non-minimal environment, you will need to add
the AppStream repository to the additional repositories:
`https://repo.almalinux.org/almalinux/8.3-beta/AppStream/x86_64/os/`.

There are no extra Installation Sources required if you decided to go with
`AlmaLinux-8.3-beta-1-x86_64-minimal.iso` or
`AlmaLinux-8.3-beta-1-x86_64-dvd1.iso` images.


## How to set up a usb key to install AlmaLinux

```bash
$ dd if=AlmaLinux-8.3-beta-1-x86_64-boot.iso of=/dev/sdX
```

Where sdX is your usb device.


## Known issues

* Our libreport/abrt packages aren’t integrated with the bugs.almalinux.org
  bug-tracker yet, so a user will have to submit a crash report manually.
  Issue: [almbz#2](https://bugs.almalinux.org/view.php?id=2).
* The “perl:5.30” module support is incomplete in the beta release, it will
  be finished in the stable.
* We don’t have the latest “jmc” and “maven” module versions. They will be
  updated later.
* The “satellite-5-client” module is located in the BaseOS repository instead
  of the AppStream. Issue: [almbz#4](https://bugs.almalinux.org/view.php?id=4).
* There is no support for Secure Boot in the beta release. Issue:
  [almbz#3](https://bugs.almalinux.org/view.php?id=3).
* The debuginfo repositories are empty and will be populated in a couple of
  days after the beta release.
