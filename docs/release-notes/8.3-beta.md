# AlmaLinux 8.3 beta release notes

The release code name: Purple [Manul](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pallas%27s_cat).

CloudLinux is proud to present the beta version of AlmaLinux. After roughly a month and a half from the announcement, here is a 1:1 RHEL binary compatible replacement for your RHEL-based systems. 

This is for the community and by the community, you're the soul of Linux. Thank you for your interest and suggestions so far, keep them coming.

Use this version to thoroughly test your workloads and report any unintended features (ie, bugs) you may find, it will help make AlmaLinux better.


## Installation instructions

There are three installation ISO images available:

[AlmaLinux-8.3-beta-1-x86_64-boot.iso](https://repo.almalinux.org/almalinux/8.3-beta/isos/x86_64/AlmaLinux-8.3-beta-1-x86_64-boot.iso) - a single network installation CD image that downloads packages over the Internet.

[AlmaLinux-8.3-beta-1-x86_64-minimal.iso](https://repo.almalinux.org/almalinux/8.3-beta/isos/x86_64/AlmaLinux-8.3-beta-1-x86_64-minimal.iso) - a minimal self-containing DVD image that makes possible offline installation.

[AlmaLinux-8.3-beta-1-x86_64-dvd1.iso](https://repo.almalinux.org/almalinux/8.3-beta/isos/x86_64/AlmaLinux-8.3-beta-1-x86_64-dvd1.iso) - a full installation DVD image that contains mostly all AlmaLinux packages. We don't really recommend using it unless you need to set up and use AlmaLinux on a machine without internet access.

Download a preferable ISO image and verify its checksum. Here is an example for GNU/Linux:

 ```bash
# download and import the AlmaLinux public key
$ wget https://repo.almalinux.org/almalinux/RPM-GPG-KEY-AlmaLinux
$ gpg --import RPM-GPG-KEY-AlmaLinux

# download a checksums list
$ wget https://repo.almalinux.org/almalinux/8.3-beta/isos/x86_64/CHECKSUM

# verify the checksums list, we are looking for “Good signature”
$ gpg --verify CHECKSUM 
gpg: Signature made Thu 28 Jan 2021 11:39:12 PM MSK
gpg:                using RSA key 51D6647EC21AD6EA
gpg: Good signature from "AlmaLinux <packager@almalinux.org>" [unknown]
gpg: WARNING: This key is not certified with a trusted signature!
gpg:          There is no indication that the signature belongs to the owner.
Primary key fingerprint: 5E9B 8F56 17B5 066C E920  57C3 488F CF7C 3ABB 34F8
     Subkey fingerprint: E53C F5EF 91CE B0AD 1812  ECB8 51D6 647E C21A D6EA

# download the network install ISO
$ wget https://repo.almalinux.org/almalinux/8.3-beta/isos/x86_64/AlmaLinux-8.3-beta-1-x86_64-boot.iso

# calculate the downloaded ISO SHA256 checksum
$ sha256sum AlmaLinux-8.3-beta-1-x86_64-boot.iso 
d15be406f417e81382b46a54d87dff01c8ca770c847c18703f19146587b61a1f  AlmaLinux-8.3-beta-1-x86_64-boot.iso

# compare it with expected checksum, it should be the same
$ cat CHECKSUM | grep -E 'SHA256.*AlmaLinux-8.3-beta-1-x86_64-boot.iso'
SHA256 (AlmaLinux-8.3-beta-1-x86_64-boot.iso) = d15be406f417e81382b46a54d87dff01c8ca770c847c18703f19146587b61a1f
 ```
 
## How to set up a usb key to install AlmaLinux
 ```bash
dd if=AlmaLinux-8.3-beta-1-x86_64-boot.iso of=/dev/sdX
 ```
Where sdX is your usb device

If you decided to use the `AlmaLinux-8.3-beta-1-x86_64-boot.iso` image, you
will need to provide this `https://repo.almalinux.org/almalinux/8.3-beta/BaseOS/x86_64/kickstart/`
repository as the Installation Source:

![installation source](./almalinux-install-source.png)

If you are going to install a non-minimal environment, you will need to add
the AppStream repository to the additional repositories:
`https://repo.almalinux.org/almalinux/8.3-beta/AppStream/x86_64/os/`.

There are no extra Installation Sources required if you decided to go with
`AlmaLinux-8.3-beta-1-x86_64-minimal.iso` or
`AlmaLinux-8.3-beta-1-x86_64-dvd1.iso` images.


## Known issues

  bug-tracker yet, so a user will have to submit a crash report manually.
  Issue: [almbz#2](https://bugs.almalinux.org/view.php?id=2).
* The “perl:5.30” module support is incomplete in the beta release, it will
  be finished in the stable.

  of the AppStream. Issue: [almbz#4](https://bugs.almalinux.org/view.php?id=4).
* There is no support for Secure Boot in the beta release. Issue:
  [almbz#3](https://bugs.almalinux.org/view.php?id=3).
