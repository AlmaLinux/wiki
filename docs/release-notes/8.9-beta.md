## Installation instructions

There are three installation ISO images available:

`AlmaLinux-8.9-beta-1-x86_64-boot.iso` - a single network installation CD image that downloads packages over the Internet.

`AlmaLinux-8.9-beta-1-x86_64-minimal.iso` - a minimal self-containing DVD image that makes possible offline installation.

`AlmaLinux-8.9-beta-1-x86_64-dvd.iso` - a full installation DVD image that contains mostly all AlmaLinux packages.

Download a suitable ISO image from the 8.9-beta/isos/$arch/ directory, for example:

```bash
$ wget https://repo.almalinux.org/almalinux/8.9-beta/isos/x86_64/AlmaLinux-8.9-beta-1-x86_64-boot.iso
```

Download and import the AlmaLinux public key:

```bash
$ wget https://repo.almalinux.org/almalinux/RPM-GPG-KEY-AlmaLinux
$ gpg --import RPM-GPG-KEY-AlmaLinux
```

Download and verify a checksums list:

```bash
$ wget https://repo.almalinux.org/almalinux/8.9-beta/isos/x86_64/CHECKSUM

# we are looking for “Good signature”
$ gpg --verify CHECKSUM
gpg: Signature made Thu 02 Nov 2023 04:46:13 AM EDT
gpg:                using RSA key E53CF5EF91CEB0AD1812ECB851D6647EC21AD6EA
gpg: Good signature from "AlmaLinux <packager@almalinux.org>" [unknown]
gpg: WARNING: This key is not certified with a trusted signature!
gpg:          There is no indication that the signature belongs to the owner.
Primary key fingerprint: 5E9B 8F56 17B5 066C E920  57C3 488F CF7C 3ABB 34F8
     Subkey fingerprint: E53C F5EF 91CE B0AD 1812  ECB8 51D6 647E C21A D6EA
```

Verify the downloaded ISO image checksum:

```bash
# calculate the downloaded ISO SHA256 checksum
$ sha256sum AlmaLinux-8.9-beta-1-x86_64-boot.iso
fe73e692f0a970c2f65f5bec1b66b10aaa02a9978eb2c4d20c751a59fe284dcd  AlmaLinux-8.9-beta-1-x86_64-boot.iso

# compare it with expected checksum, it should be the same
$ cat CHECKSUM | grep -E 'SHA256.*AlmaLinux-8.9-beta-1-x86_64-boot.iso'
SHA256 (AlmaLinux-8.9-beta-1-x86_64-boot.iso) = fe73e692f0a970c2f65f5bec1b66b10aaa02a9978eb2c4d20c751a59fe284dcd
```

If you decide to use the `AlmaLinux-8.9-beta-1-x86_64-boot.iso` image, you may need to provide the `https://repo.almalinux.org/vault/8.9-beta/BaseOS/x86_64/kickstart/` URL repository as the Installation Source in the event that the installer is not able to find it automatically for some reason.

There are no extra Installation Sources required if you decided to go with either the Minimal or DVD ISO images.

## Upgrade Instructions

**Please do not use these update instructions on production machines unless you don't mind if something breaks** ;)

Upgrade the almalinux-release package to the 8.9-0.0.el8 version from the beta repositories:

```bash
$ dnf install -y https://repo.almalinux.org/vault/almalinux-release-latest-8-beta.x86_64.rpm
$ dnf clean all
```

the new package contains updated repository URLs so that you can just run:

```bash
$ dnf upgrade -y
```

to update the rest of the packages.
