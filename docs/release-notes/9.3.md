## Installation instructions

There are three installation ISO images available:

`AlmaLinux-9.3-x86_64-boot.iso` - a single network installation CD image that downloads packages over the Internet.

`AlmaLinux-9.3-x86_64-minimal.iso` - a minimal self-containing DVD image that makes possible offline installation.

`AlmaLinux-9.3-x86_64-dvd.iso` - a full installation DVD image that contains mostly all AlmaLinux packages.

You can select a mirror closest to your geographic area listed on the [mirrors.almalinux.org](https://mirrors.almalinux.org) website. A local mirror will be a lot quicker than using `repo.almalinux.org` directly. Then, download a suitable ISO image from the 9.3/isos/$arch/ directory of your source, for example:

```bash
$ wget https://atl.mirrors.knownhost.com/almalinux/9.3/isos/x86_64/AlmaLinux-9.3-x86_64-boot.iso
```

Download and import the AlmaLinux public key:

```bash
$ wget https://repo.almalinux.org/almalinux/RPM-GPG-KEY-AlmaLinux-9
$ gpg --import RPM-GPG-KEY-AlmaLinux-9
```

Download and verify a checksums list:

```bash
$ wget https://repo.almalinux.org/almalinux/9.3/isos/x86_64/CHECKSUM

# we are looking for “Good signature”
$ gpg --verify CHECKSUM
gpg: Signature made Sun 12 Nov 2023 06:08:57 PM EST
gpg:                using RSA key D36CB86CB86B3716
gpg: Good signature from "AlmaLinux OS 9 <packager@almalinux.org>" [unknown]
gpg: WARNING: This key is not certified with a trusted signature!
gpg:          There is no indication that the signature belongs to the owner.
Primary key fingerprint: BF18 AC28 7617 8908 D6E7  1267 D36C B86C B86B 3716
```

Verify the downloaded ISO image checksum:

```bash
# calculate the downloaded ISO SHA256 checksum
$ sha256sum AlmaLinux-9.3-x86_64-boot.iso
af5377a1d16bbe599ea91a8761ad645f2f54687075802bdc0c0703ee610182e9  AlmaLinux-9.3-x86_64-boot.iso

# compare it with expected checksum, it should be the same
$ cat CHECKSUM | grep -E 'SHA256.*AlmaLinux-9.3-x86_64-boot.iso'
SHA256 (AlmaLinux-9.3-x86_64-boot.iso) = af5377a1d16bbe599ea91a8761ad645f2f54687075802bdc0c0703ee610182e9
```

If you decide to use the `AlmaLinux-9.3-x86_64-boot.iso` image, you may need to provide the `9.3/BaseOS/x86_64/kickstart/` URL repository from the selected mirror as the Installation Source in the event that the installer is not able to find the closest mirror for some reason.

There are no extra Installation Sources required if you decided to go with either the minimal or DVD ISO images.

## Upgrade Instructions

To update your AlmaLinux OS 9 to 9.3 run:

```bash
$ dnf upgrade -y
```
