## Installation instructions

There are three installation ISO images available:

`AlmaLinux-9.3-beta-1-x86_64-boot.iso` - a single network installation CD image that downloads packages over the Internet.

`AlmaLinux-9.3-beta-1-x86_64-minimal.iso` - a minimal self-containing DVD image that makes possible offline installation.

`AlmaLinux-9.3-beta-1-x86_64-dvd.iso` - a full installation DVD image that contains mostly all AlmaLinux packages.

Download a suitable ISO image from the 9.3-beta/isos/$arch/ directory, for example:

```bash
$ wget https://repo.almalinux.org/almalinux/9.3-beta/isos/x86_64/AlmaLinux-9.3-beta-1-x86_64-boot.iso
```

Download and import the AlmaLinux public key:

```bash
$ wget https://repo.almalinux.org/almalinux/RPM-GPG-KEY-AlmaLinux-9
$ gpg --import RPM-GPG-KEY-AlmaLinux
```

Download and verify a checksums list:

```bash
$ wget https://repo.almalinux.org/almalinux/9.3-beta/isos/x86_64/CHECKSUM

# we are looking for “Good signature”
$ gpg --verify CHECKSUM
gpg: Signature made Wed 25 Oct 2023 12:28:57 PM EDT
gpg:                using RSA key BF18AC2876178908D6E71267D36CB86CB86B3716
gpg: Good signature from "AlmaLinux OS 9 <packager@almalinux.org>" [unknown]
gpg: WARNING: This key is not certified with a trusted signature!
gpg:          There is no indication that the signature belongs to the owner.
Primary key fingerprint: BF18 AC28 7617 8908 D6E7  1267 D36C B86C B86B 3716
```

Verify the downloaded ISO image checksum:

```bash
# calculate the downloaded ISO SHA256 checksum
$ sha256sum AlmaLinux-9.3-beta-1-x86_64-boot.iso
7bca61c7b67e27db9194ddacec3ad3983f25a781721a69bbf5586903d9075465  AlmaLinux-9.3-beta-1-x86_64-boot.iso

# compare it with expected checksum, it should be the same
$ cat CHECKSUM | grep -E 'SHA256.*AlmaLinux-9.3-beta-1-x86_64-boot.iso'
SHA256 (AlmaLinux-9.3-beta-1-x86_64-boot.iso) = 7bca61c7b67e27db9194ddacec3ad3983f25a781721a69bbf5586903d9075465
```

If you decide to use the `AlmaLinux-9.3-beta-1-x86_64-boot.iso` image, you may need to provide the `https://repo.almalinux.org/vault/9.3-beta/BaseOS/x86_64/kickstart/` URL repository as the Installation Source in the event that the installer is not able to find it automatically for some reason.

There are no extra Installation Sources required if you decided to go with either the minimal or DVD ISO images.


## Upgrade Instructions

**Please do not use these update instructions on production machines unless you don't mind if something breaks** ;)

Upgrade the almalinux-release packages to the 9.3-0.4.el9 version from the beta repositories:

```bash
$ dnf install -y https://repo.almalinux.org/vault/almalinux-{release,repos,gpg-keys}-latest-9-beta.x86_64.rpm
$ dnf clean all
```

the new package contains updated repository URLs so that you can just run:

```bash
$ dnf upgrade -y
```

to update the rest of the packages.
