#### Provider specific changes:

* vmware_desktop
  - Switch from BIOS to UEFI boot on x86_64.
  - Use VMXNET Generation 3 (VMXNET3) as the network adapter, as it is the latest, offers the best performance, and is compatible with the AlmaLinux OS kernel.
  - Upgrade the VMware virtual machine hardware version from 9 to 21, which is the latest. Since all desktop VMware products are now free, adopting the latest version will be faster, eventually encouraging users to utilize all the features of the latest hardware version.
